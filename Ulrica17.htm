      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">After

        placid and positive self and vows to say only nice things this time around.

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">As 
        many of you know, Super <a href="events/Bruce%20Retirement/Nruceintro.html"><strong>Bruce 
        McNaughton</strong></a> was back on the boards only days after suffering 
        a heart attack while riding his bike. He went to the ER and spent a night 
        at Kaiser Hospital, yet he was in the audience for a <em>Tosca </em> performance 
        three days later. By mere chance, his cardiologist was in the audience, 
        too. Then, in true Super Trouper fashion, he performed in Acts I and III 
        during the following show, and in all three acts during the show after 
        that. Devoted as she is to her craft, Ulrica couldn't promise to do the 
        same under such trying circumstances. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Bruce 
        is surely the favorite for this year's <strong>Stephanie Salter</strong> 
        Whine Award, whereby a Super who has the greatest cause to whine, but 
        doesn't, wins the Award. He promises to return to San Francisco for the 
        <a href="events/BakeSaleandAnnualParty.htm">party on December 11th</a>.</font></p>

        <a href="events/Bruce%20Retirement/partypics/index.htm">party for Bruce</a> 
        at Buca di Beppo on October 20th had already been planned, so the Supers 
        went ahead and gathered to wish Bruce “Happy Trails” before his departure 
        for Dayton, Ohio (date, as yet, unclear). Among the stellar guests were 
        the former and current Super Captains, <strong>Albert Goodwyn </strong>and 
        <strong>Carrie Murphy</strong>. Albert is looking great, and Carrie (always 
        looking great) stayed busy working the tables. Supers <strong>Irene Bechte</strong>l, 
        <strong>Jenny Jirousek</strong>, <strong>Priscilla Lore</strong>, and 
        <strong>Katherine Brazaitis</strong> (recovered from her recent foot operation 
        but nursing a bad wrist) added glamour to the evening. Sitting next to 
        each other, and bridging decades of Supering, were veteran <strong>Paul 
        Ricks</strong> and newbie <strong>Derek Ailes</strong>. According to <strong>Mike 
        Harvey</strong>, Derek is up for a Hammy. </font></p>
      <p align="left" class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><img src="funstuff/images/Ulrica10_30/derek.jpg" width="162" height="106" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="left">“<font style="color:black;">In
             Act II, Derek filled in at the last minute for Bruce and became
            confused, believing that Cavaradossi 
        was going to hit Tosca instead of Scarpia (<strong>Miroslav Dvorsky</strong>, 
        <strong>Carol Vaness</strong>, and <strong>Mark Delavan</strong>, respectively).
         So Derek hesitated when he was supposed to grab Miroslav, who discovered
        
        that he had to do something during the delay, so he just grabbed Mark
         in a huge Russian bear hug. I tried to pry them apart, and Carol started
        
        to jump into what was beginning to look like a m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. We
         finally untangled the knot, and Super Bad Guy Paul delivered a punch
        to 
        Miroslav so convincingly that our hero sagged to his knees and I was
        left  trying to drag his 250-pound weight out the door. Finally, Derek
        extricated 
        himself from Carol and joined us for our exit. Once we were offstage.
         Mirislav bear-hugged Derek, who was at the point of nervous collapse.
        
        A good time was had by all.”<br>

        in Lucca, Italy. Kathleen has been freelancing all across the country: 
        in Eugene, Oregon, and Santa Fe, New Mexico, where she worked on a production 
        of <em>Don Giovanni </em> that, spookily, had been seen by three people

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">At 
        another of the <em>Tosca </em> rehearsals, Sandy quoted maestro <strong>Donald 
        Runnicles</strong> as saying, “This is the best <em>Tosca </em> cast ever 
        seen at the War Memorial.” Although the cast <em>is </em> spectacular, 
        and I dote on Carol Vaness (and mean her no disrespect), the comment made 
        me reflect on the first, and surely the greatest, War Memorial <em>Tosca</em>, 
        the truly divine Claudia Muzio. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">One 
        of the greatest and most celebrated sopranos of the first half of the 
        twentieth century, with one of the most distinctive and expressive voices 
        ever to be recorded, La Muzio had a voice that could break your heart. 
        </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Born 
        on February 7, 1889, in Pavia, near Milan, she was the daughter of theatrical 
        parents. She established her reputation at La Scala and Covent Garden 
        and became an idol in her native country. Entire populations of small 
        towns would come out to see her as she passed. As an actress, she was 
        compared to Eleanora Duse, and although no film footage of her exists, 
        sequential photographs give us some idea of her penetrating portrayals 
        of characters such as both Verdi Leonoras, Violetta, Tatiana, and Georgette 
        from <em>Il Tabarro</em>, a role she created in 1918. She was a favorite 
        of Chicago critic Claudia Cassidy and, later, of singer Maria Callas. 
        A generous but reclusive personality, she always traveled with her mother 
        or a companion and rarely mingled with her peers. Rosa Ponselle was one 
        of her few operatic friends. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Muzio
           sang extensively in South America and was a huge success in Rio de
          Janeiro, 
        Montevideo, and Buenos Aires, where she became the lover of a young Aristotle
           Onassis — the first in his collection of famous women, which included
            not only Callas and Jacqueline Kennedy, but also Eva Peron and Greta
           Garbo. 
        In the United States, she sang sporadically at the Met, giving three
           legendary  performances of <em>Traviata </em> in 1933, but was enormously
           popular  in Chicago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, where she performed
           with the 
        San Francisco Opera on tour. She was chosen to inaugurate the War Memorial
            Opera House on October 15, 1932, with her portrayal of Tosca in a
           production 
        that was the inspiration for our current one. A plaque commemorating
           the  occasion hangs in the Opera House lobby, and, curiously, the
           only extant 
        live recording of this great artist comes from a broadcast of the first
            act of that opening night, one of the earliest surviving opera broadcasts. 
        <em><a href="funstuff/images/Ulrica10_30/newclaudiaclip.mp3">Here's an
        excerpt (warning - large file).</a></em> She made studio recordings at
        three points during her career, but sadly the earliest sessions, recorded
        in
        her prime,
        are poorly recorded in the 
        inferior “hill and dale” medium. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Claudia 
        Muzio is best known, therefore, for the series of recordings she made 
        in the mid-1930s, when her voice had lost some of its range, but her interpretive 
        gifts were at their height. These recordings have saved her from obscurity. 
        Norman White's program notes for the CD&nbsp; (<em>Muzio</em> on Nimbus, 
        from the Prima Voce series) state, “We are treated to an experience in 
        human terms almost unequalled in the history of recorded sound.” Having 
        suffered a decline in her health and fortune, she reputedly approached 
        a Roman crime lord and borrowed the money to make these famous recordings. 
        The outstanding cut, and the singular piece she is now most remembered 
        for, is her beautiful and anguished <em>Addio del Passato </em>from the 
        final act of <em>La Traviata. </em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">It 
        was a prescient choice for the “Duse of Song.” A year later, on May 24, 
        1936, at the age of 46, she died in Rome. The official cause was heart 
        failure, but she almost certainly died by her own hand.</font></p>

        <em>Tosca </em> Supers were finally recognized in a program insert that

        the insert was missing one name, which Carrie thoughtfully wrote in by

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">We 
        also hear that artists' requests to approve cuts to their bios are not 
        always honored. SFO is, apparently, notorious for butchering said bios: 
        a case of “omit the Met debut but keep ‘as a teenager sang the lead in 
        many community theater productions of <em>Annie </em>'.” </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">But 
        the crowning mis-achievement for the program production staff must have 
        been when “difficult” British mezzo <strong>Alice Coote</strong> was contracted 
        for her SFO debut two seasons ago. Originally scheduled to sing Hansel 
        in <em>Hansel and Gretel</em>, she was given the role of Ruggerio when 
        they added Handel's <em>Alcina </em>to the schedule<em>. </em> Although 
        Ruggerio was the more coveted role, she apparently retained animosity 
        toward the artist who was hired to sing Hansel in her place, Sara Fulgoni. 
        Imagine, then, the Coote dressing room <em>scena </em> when the <em>Alcina 
        </em> programs arrived from the printer. There above the biography for 
        Alice Coote was a picture of ... Sara Fulgoni! </font></p>

        the much anticipated audition for the sole Super in <em>Eugene Onegin</em> 
        this week, fifteen or more 6&#8217;1&#8221;-and-under Supers were kept 
        waiting in the Ballet Studio for over an hour before Director and AD, 
        the cheerful duo <strong>Johannes Schaaf</strong> and <strong>Roy Rallo</strong>, 
        showed up. After staring at one likely candidate for ten minutes, Herr 
        Schaaf deemed him &#8220;too tall&#8221; and left. And so the search continues, 
        no doubt at great, additional expense. Although Herr S surely has his 
        followers I wouldn&#8217;t count Finnish superstar <strong>Karita Mattila</strong> 
        among them. <img src="funstuff/images/Ulrica10_30/karita.jpg" width="101" height="136" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="right">The

        with <strong>Anthony Laciura</strong>) <img src="/funstuff/images/Ulrica10_30/denisetosca.jpg" width="175" height="141" align="right">observed 
        that the <em>Tosca </em> Supers are giving the best performances she can 
        remember. That's saying a lot, considering that most of us are only onstage 
        for a few minutes, but it means we're making the most of it. It does feel 
        good to get some recognition (outside of our family, close friends, and 
        fellow Supers) during these dispirited Super days. Thanks, Denise, we 
        appreciate it. </font></p>

        planning a field trip to see Super <strong>Louis Schilling </strong> in 
        a role that requires <em>making sound </em> onstage. He's the male lead 
        in the Actors Ensemble of Berkeley production of Noel Coward's <em>Present 
        Laughter. </em>We plan to go on Friday, November 5. Admission is only 
        $10, and we're going to try to carpool. If you're interested, go to their 
        <a href="http://www.aeofberkeley.org/" target="_blank">website</a> to 
        purchase tickets, and drop Ulrica a line; she'll do what she can to get

        anyone seen dresser <strong>Joe Potter</strong>'s apron? He loaned it 
        to a Bake Sale Super during the run of <em>La Boh&egrave;me </em> and

        late Julia Child, so it has sentimental value. </font></p>

        terms of visual wit and excitement in musical theater, SFO will have a 
        hard job surpassing the recent ACT offering,<em> The Black Rider. </em> 
        It's hard to believe that this was the first time a Robert Wilson production 
        has been seen in San Francisco. Just a couple of years ago, his designs 
        for <em>Lohengrin </em> at the Met received overwhelmingly good reviews. 
        <em>Rider </em>is a celebration of the gravelly voice, with text by William 
        S. Burroughs and songs by Tom Waits. It starred Marianne Faithfull, singing 
        the role of the Devil. The story is based on the same German folk tale 
        as Weber's amazing Romantic opera <em>Der Freischutz. </em>Sad to say 
        <em> Freischutz </em>was dumped from SFO's 2003&#8211;04 season. And we 
        got dreary <em>Doktor Faust </em> instead? </font></p>

        to the five 5-feet-1-inch-tall women who have been bumped from the ending 
        of <em>Der Fliegende Hollander. </em>This had been the Great Hope for 
        the women Supers this year. What we need is a production of <em>The Dialogues 
        of the Carmelites </em> (or the other nun opera <em>Suor Angelica</em>) 
        on a grand scale, with unlimited ops for Super Ladies. I hope so. Some 
        of those indignant Super Dames were getting quite vociferous at the McNaughton 
        dinner.</font></p>

        Scoop on Parking from <em>One Who Knows </em></strong></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em>The 
        Spearhead</em> received the following enlightening missive on the subject 
        of parking, which is always a hot issue. The situation is a lot more complex 
        than we had imagined. But it is nice to know that company policy is not 
        an example of anti-Superism.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"><em><img src="images/Project1.gif" width="270" height="195"></em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"><em>Just 
        a couple of notes for Ulrica, in reference to <a href="Ulrica16.htm">your 
        article</a>. Parking in the lots is regulated by several contracts. For 
        example, the administrative and daytime production staff (props, wig room, 
        etc.) have spots in the lot on McAllister Street (WoWo, for you old-timers). 
        These are apportioned to people by way of monthly contracts, and some 
        of the parkers must pay. No one without a monthly contract may park in 
        the McAllister lot, even if the Fulton Street lots are full. Cars will 
        be towed if their owners don't have reserved spots. In the Fulton lots, 
        the aggressive parking staff are members of a subcontracted parking and 
        security service. All SF Opera staff who have contracts bestowing Provided 
        Parking receive a memo outlining new parking procedures, which include 
        the following: You must show the House-issued parking pass; security staff 
        may ask to see your driver's license; and security staff may take away 
        expired passes, destroy them, and kick you out. As far as the famous soprano, 
        soloists are often charged for company-provided housing (CAN YOU BELIEVE 
        THAT?) — parking is a mere bagatelle compared to that. </em></font> </p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><em><font size="2">I 
        don't know if you've ever seen the lots at curtain, but they're bloody 
        full; in fact, they are downright inadequate. There really is no room 
        at the inn.</font></em></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">May 
        Ulrica suggest a parking solution? If you reach Franklin Street just before 
        or a few minutes after 6 PM on weekdays, you can almost always find a 
        metered space north of the Opera House. Stay with your car until 6, though. 
        (One or two of the blocks on the west side are tow-away zones until 7 
        PM, so check the signs.) If your call is at 6:30 or 7, you'll have plenty 
        of time to visit the Crepe House on Gough for the best local food deal 
        and the stimulating company of fellow Supers and production people.</font></p>
