        <strong><font color="#990000" size="3">2006 Hammy Awards</font></strong></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><em>Following is the text of 
        the Hammy Award presentation speech given at the 2006 Super Party by Rob 
        Wonder and Kimberly Thompson:</em></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was a Super&#8217;s 
        nightmare. You get your first real part on the Opera House stage, and 
        you are thrown into an extensive role under very difficult conditions. 
        The requirements? Hitting complicated, exactly timed marks with your vision 
        blinded by semi-transparent veils and glaring spotlights, and performing 
        intricate tasks handicapped by bulky gloves. Now imagine that the original 
        Super has dropped out, and you, the cover, are attempting your first outing 
        in this role during a performance of <em>Madame Butterfly</em>. For jumping 
        in with both feet and coming out the hero, the All-About-Eve Hammy goes 
        to <strong><a href="strickland.jpg">Michael Strickland</a></strong>.<br>
        <br>
        The wedding scene in <em>The Marriage of Figaro</em> is a joyful, grand 
        affair. The entire court emerges to celebrate the wedding of Figaro and 
        Susanna, but in 2006, it was the entrance of two Supers that stole the 
        show. It wasn&#8217;t their cute costumes or the bad dental work that 
        caught the audience&#8217;s attention. One of two Bridesmaids from Hell 
        misstepped, and in the spirit of Super support, the other attempted a 
        rescue. The result was an avalanche of petticoats and shawls blocking 
        the entrance of Antonio, played by <strong>Peter Strummer</strong>. In 
        honor of this occasion, the Jack-Falls-Down-and-Jill-Goes-Tumbling-After 
        Hammy goes to <strong>Barbara Edwards</strong> and <strong>Irene Bechtel</strong>.<br>
        <br>
        While much of the focus of <em>A Masked Ball</em> is on the King and his 
        romantic attraction to Amelia, you tend to overlook the two other young 
        lovers who meander through the ballroom set, engaged in &#8220;canoodling&#8221; 
        on the balcony, and who are totally oblivious to the intrigue and tragedy 
        in the making. The It's-All-About-Me Hammy goes to <strong><a href="http://spearheadnews.com/images/Ballo2006pics/Gallery1/source/ballo_pair.htm" target="_blank">Yvette 
        Forte Rosedale</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://spearheadnews.com/images/Ballo2006pics/Gallery1/source/ballo_pair.htm" target="_blank">Bradly 
        Hamilton</a></strong>. <br>
        <br>
        In a moment of <em>Fledermaus</em> celebration, a champagne glass crashes 
        to the floor. A vigilant Super rushes to the rescue and cleans up the 
        shards. He is so focused on his work, he bends over to moon the audience, 
        completing the job. The Bottoms-Up Hammy goes to <strong>Rob Wonder</strong>.<br>
        <br>
        One of our favorite Supering activities is making an entrance. Whether 
        raised up from the trap, flown in, or carried in on a litter, nothing 
        beats the splash of a great entrance. Exiting the stage is another story. 
        Most of the time we either slink off on cue, stand in place as the curtain 
        comes in, or vanish in a blackout. Not so for one of our Supers, who, 
        15 minutes before the end of each performance of <em>Tristan und Isolde</em>, 
        not only fought with Adler Fellow <strong>Sean Pennikar</strong>, but 
        also wound up getting shoved backward off the end of a 12-foot-high, steeply 
        raked stage and onto a crash pad, making him the envy of everyone who 
        ever played <em>Tosca</em>. Good thing for him he had a lot of diving 
        experience! The Get-Me-to-the-Dressing-Room-Fast Hammy goes to <strong><a href="http://spearheadnews.com/images/Tristanpics/source/img_4036.htm" target="_blank">Kurt 
        Krikorian</a></strong>.<br>
        <br>
        It appears that being chosen for a role doesn't guarantee that one is 
        going to perform it. The <em>Manon Lescaut</em> production was fraught 
        with changes, substitutions, and at a few points, ejections. Prostitutes 
        were dropped and others took their places. Even the names were changed 
        to protect the innocent. The Act 1 students put up a good fight, but eventually 
        they got the axe. The Executioner's Assistant one week returned to being 
        a servant the next. The one thing that remains constant in a Super's life 
        is change. The You-Can't-Tell-a-Cover-Without-a-Program Hammy (or, the 
        Musical-Chairs Hammy) goes to the entire Super <a href="http://spearheadnews.com/images/manonpics/source/p1040893.htm" target="_blank">cast</a> 
        of <em>Manon Lescaut</em>.<br>
        <br>
        They were just hanging out at the well, as they had done a dozen times, 
        waiting for Carmen to make a break for it, when Zuniga, a.k.a. <strong>Ricardo 
        Herrera</strong>, passes by and whispers, &quot;Just follow me.&quot; 
        They pause <img src="../../committee/committeeimages/aprilhammie.jpg" width="225" height="224" hspace="3" vspace="0" align="left">and 
        then do what any good Super does faced with a split-second decision in 
        a spontaneous performance moment: They do what they are told! They followed 
        him to stage right and then had to make a long full-out run to stage left 
        to chase Carmen. Did it make for a better performance? It sure did: the 
        director told them to leave it in. The We-Were-Just-Following-Orders-Sir 
        Hammy goes to <strong>John F. Martin</strong> and <strong>Rick Weil</strong>.<br>
        <br>
        It is unheard of that anyone other than a Super might be the recipient 
        of a coveted Hammy Award. However, with Supers willing to beg, borrow, 
        or steal to be in a show, the job of finding just the right cogs to fit 
        into the opera production machinery is more than daunting. This is especially 
        true when one is unfamiliar with the available cogs, who must be time 
        flexible, USDA reliable, cause no side effects, fit costume specifications 
        to within millimeters, and blend smoothly with the other cogs. The multiple 
        personalities of the Super corps also add anxiety and stress to this job. 
        So, for being such a nice person and competent administrator, the Not-All-the-Tap-Dancing-Happens-Onstage 
        Hammy goes to our fearless leader, <strong>April Busch</strong>.</font></p>

      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many of the winners were not 
        there to claim their Hammys, which was providential, as there were not 
        enough anyway. The Super Committee is having more made. If you were one 
        of the winners and desire your Hammy (and who wouldn't?), please <a href="mailto:supercommittee@spearheadnews.com">contact
