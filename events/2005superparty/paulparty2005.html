        2005 Super Party: Glitz and Glam</strong></font></p>
      <p align="center" style="margin-top: 0;"><font size="2">Paul

      <p> <font size="2">It was all glitz 
        and glam on Sunday, November 20 at the <a href="http://www.ggyc.org/" target="_blank">Golden 
        Gate Yacht Club</a>. Over 140 Supers and their guests assembled at that 
        spectacular venue, with sweeping views of the Golden Gate Bridge, the 
        Palace of Fine Arts, Alcatraz, the bay and the San Francisco skyline. 
        Unseasonably warm weather and crystal-clear skies were an added present.<br>
        <br>
        Friends chatted and caught up with each other during the cocktail hour 
        preceding dinner. Several were spotted appropriately attired in an array 
        of costumes, including <strong>Katherine Brazaitis</strong> as a tin soldier, 
        <strong>Kimberly Thompson</strong> in a spectacular dress she purchased 
        at the Costume Shop sale, <strong>Frank Sommers</strong> as a Cossack 
        and <strong>Barbara Sherman</strong> as Queen (please note, that&#8217;s 
        with a capital Q).</font></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"><img src="/events/2005superparty/paulpartypics/composite.jpg" width="592" height="207"><br>
        The dinner bell was rung by committee-member <strong>Bradly Hamilton</strong> 
        and 
        the buffet line moved along, as guests chose between grilled breast of
        chicken and grilled tri tip. <img src="/events/2005superparty/paulpartypics/brad.jpg" width="150" height="225" hspace="4" align="right">Also on the menu was a puree of truffle-infused
        Yukon Gold potatoes, roasted Mediterannean vegetables, and a yummy mushroom
        spinach salad. Dinner was conceived and executed by Executive Chef <strong>Michael 
        Buffington</strong> of <a href="http://www.intimate-catering.com/" target="_blank">Intimate 
        Catering</a>. Wine flowed, conversation spun, and the party was off and 
        running.<br>
        <br>
        While cake and coffee were being served, the evening&#8217;s entertainment 
        began. With writer-director-producer <strong>Charlie Lichtman</strong> 
        otherwise involved in the final three productions of the season and another 
        show with the San Francisco Symphony, this year the skit was replaced 
        by performances by bass <strong>Matthew Trevi&ntilde;o</strong> and tenor 
        <strong>Brian Frutiger</strong>, singing excerpts from opera as well as 
        American musical theater. The two Merolini brought the audience to their 
        feet.<br>
        <br>
        The lovely and talented <strong>Priscilla Lore</strong> was up next to 
        acknowledge some of those who have made special contributions this year. 
        Among those recognized were <strong>Joan Imbeau</strong>, <strong>Irene 
        Bechtel</strong>, Kimberly Thompson, <strong>Sharon Castle</strong>, <strong>Tom 
        Carlisle</strong>, <strong>Rene DeJarnatt</strong>, the <em>Spearhead</em> 
        Web Site Team, as well as everyone who contributed to the bake sales and 
        garage sale during the year. <br>
        <br>
        <img src="/events/2005superparty/paulpartypics/awards.jpg" width="200" height="133" align="left">Committee 
        members Kimberly Thompson and <strong>Rob Wonder</strong> presented the 
        Hammy Awards (lovingly hand-crafted by Super <strong>John Janonis</strong>) 
        to deserving Supers for performances during the season. <strong>Al Heibein</strong>, 
        who was replaced late in the process as Lt. Bush in <em>Doctor Atomic</em> 
        but still had to show up as the alternate throughout the run, received 
        the &#8220;Alternate&#8217;s Nightmare&#8221; Hammy. The &#8220;Show Must 
        Go On&#8221; Hammy was presented to <strong>Ron Mann</strong> who, after 
        surviving not one but two ankle injuries in the line of Supering duty, 
        taped up and actually included his hobbling into his demanding portrayal 
        of Vlad the Impailer in <em>L&#8217;Italiana in Algieri</em>. Other Hammies 
        were presented to <strong>Alec Page</strong> and <strong>Alexander Roe</strong> 
        in <em>Rodelinda</em>, <strong>and John Guglielmeli</strong> in <em>La 
        Forza del Destino</em>, <strong>Steve Clarke</strong> in <em>Fidelio</em>, 
        <strong>Walt Thorp</strong> in <em>The Pearl Fishers</em>, and <strong>Eddie 
        Gordillo</strong> in <em>L&#8217;Italiana in Algieri</em>. Somehow, the 
        blue-butt boys in <em>Norma</em> were left standing awardless with their 
        butts to the audience, obviously an error on the part of the Super Committee.<br>
        <br>
        The final Hammy of the evening for following the strict House rules pertaining 
        to Supers, including remembering to sign in (well, except that one time), 
        <img src="/events/2005superparty/paulpartypics/pam.jpg" width="150" height="225" align="right">being 
        able to take stage direction, and never being seen eating in costume, 
        while portraying her character in <em>The Magic Flute for Kids</em> in 
        a convincing manner, the &quot;Seeing the Forest for the Tree&#8221; Hammy 
        went to first-time Super <strong>Pamela Rosenberg</strong>. It seemed 
        that Pamela was truly grateful for being chosen for the award, and was 
        stunned to also receive additional recognition for the job she has done 
        as General Director for the past five years. A silver spear pin, created 
        by silversmith Super <strong>Keith Bartell</strong> was also presented 
        to her.<br>
        <br>
        In presenting the pin, the following remarks were made: &quot;Tonight 
        we would like to acknowledge Pamela Rosenberg for the contributions she 
        has made to San Francisco Opera and the City of San Francisco during her 
        time as General Director. She could have no idea when she arrived that 
        she would see the dot-com implosion and the events of September 11, all 
        while trying to steer this endeavor called the San Francisco Opera. In 
        addition to bringing the company back to sound financial footing and successfully 
        completing a series of labor contract negotiations, she has brought San 
        Francisco a dazzling array of productions, including <em>Saint Francoise 
        D&#8217;Assisse</em>, <em>Le Grand Macabre</em>, and the world premiere 
        of <em>Doctor Atomic</em>. We saw bold new productions and had the opportunity 
        to work with exciting directors and an array of singers never heard before 
        in San Francisco. Tonight, we Supers say &#8216;Thank you&#8217;, Pamela 
        Rosenberg.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        <img src="/events/2005superparty/paulpartypics/tom.jpg" width="200" height="133" align="left">To 
        close the evening, Super Coordinator <strong>Carrie Murphy</strong> presented 
        the Super of the Year Award to <strong>Tom Carlisle</strong> for all of 
        the many ways he supports Supers and the opera all year long. Some of 
        the many ways he serves Supers include his insightful interviews for <em>The 
        Spearhead</em>, creating the Super scrapbooks, arranging Super photo ops 
        for all the productions, arriving early at Opera in the Park to lay claim 
        to the space in front of the stage for all Supers, and being our institutional 
        memory bank. Thank you, Tom Carlisle for your many years of service as 
        a super Super.<br>

        Opera General Director <strong>Davi</strong><strong>d Gockley</strong> 
        was also in attendance, mixing with the crowd and showing how comfortable 
        he can be with the likes of the Supers. Perhaps this is a foreshadowing 
        of things to come.</font></p>
