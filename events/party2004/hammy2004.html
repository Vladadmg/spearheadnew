      <h5>Hammy Awards 2004</h5>
      <p><em>La
        Traviata</em> - <br>
        This Hammy goes to two co-conspirators. You all recall the very sexy
        flamenco dancers at Flora's party. Well, this pair of Supers didn't feel
        that their
      backstage view was adequate, so they asked an ASM if they could return
      to the stage and stand in a doorway to get better views of the performance.
      They succeeded, well worth the &quot;hey-this-show's-all-about-me&quot; Hammy
      award, which goes to Steven Clark and Ray Sullivan.<br>
      <br>
      <em>La Boheme</em> -<br>
      This veteran Super was the cover for the waiters in La Boheme. The waiters
      had a brief but nerve-racking plate toss where they threw plastic plates
      across stage to each other. On one of the occasions that John was covering
      for Scott Sanford he accidentally threw the plate off-course and it was
      heading straight towards the Musetta of that evening, threatening decapitation.
      All looked on in horror but the swift moves of another super waiter knocked
      the plate off it's deadly course and it went crashing safely to the floor.
      The Hammy goes to John Martin.<br>
      <br>
      <em>La Traviata</em> -<br>
      In TRAVIATA, as the action moves to Flora's Party, six of the elegant and
      well mannered male servants are pre-set onstage and serve wine and champagne
      to the guests in the blue room. During this scene, all the servants at
      one time or another are to exit Up Stage Right or Left to pick up more
      trays of champagne flutes and return to further serve the guests. At their
      appointed time, two of the servants, Production Super Captain Mark Burstein
      and Steve Bauman leave, on cue. Unfortunately, only one reappears. Flora's
      guests, in this case lady choristers, are left without a server and their
      champaign flute props!! This is not insignificant and several choristers
      are somewhat distressed that they have been left unattended and make comments
      to that affect to stationary servants Philippe Arbeit and Rob Wonder. As
      always, the show went on and no one (except those mentioned here) knew
      the difference. Asked about his momentary lapse afterwards in the canteen,
      Steve acknowledged that he had simply forgotten to go back on stage. For
      that omission, Steve Bauman is awarded a Hammie.<br> 
      <br>
      <em>Billy Budd</em> and <em>Tosca</em> - <br>
      For having the most mutinous and indomitable lag cramps of the 2004 season,
      this Super cramped up onstage in Billy Budd and the tradition continued
      well into Tosca. Although no doubt a painful nuisance, his condition afforded
      several supers an opportunity to step in at the last minute and find their
      own tiny bit off the spotlight. This award is given to Bjon Farber with
      the hope that he has completely recovered and will be ready to perform
      on two strong legs in the 2005 season.<br>
      <br>
      <em>Tosca</em> -<br>
      This super very dramatically arranged to have a heart attack during the
      run of Tosca. Not, unfortunately, onstage as he would have preferred, but
      on the morning of a day before a performance. After an overnight stay in
      the hospital, he took MUNI directly to the Opera House to make sure his
      signature role of Scarpi&#8217;s Agent was somehow going to be covered.
      He had to be physically restrained by security guards as he attempted his
      Act I entrance dragging an IV stand and oxygen supply and finally agreed
      to stand aside and watch the show from the House. The &#8220;I NEVER Miss
      a Performance&#8221; Hammy goes to Bruce McNaughton.<br>
      <br>
      <em>Tosca</em> - <br>
      One of our newest Supers bravely stepped in at the last minute to cover
      for Bruce Mcnaughton in Tosca. He had watched the scene several times and
      was observed to have been personally coached at least once by Carol Vaness
      during rehearsal. But a real performance is something different. The scene
      consists of dragging Cavarodossi back and forth at least 5 times and finally
      seizing him as he attempts to attack Scarpia. Our novice did well until
      the last moment when Cavaradossi finally raised his fist. This new super
      somehow became confused and figured that Cav was going to hit Tosca and
      was so appalled that he froze for second or two. Poor Cav was expecting
      to be restrained by him and when that didn&#8217;t happen he just leaped
      on poor Scarpia and gave him a big Russian bear hug. Carol Vaness and Mike
      Harvey joined in and it looked for a while like props might have to use
      a fire hose to separate the combatants. The crowd finally got Cavarodossi
      turned around in time for Paul Szczesiul to slug him and they all limped
      offstage. Mirislav then gave our hammy winner, Derek Ailes, his own bone-crushing
      bear hug offstage and a pat on the back for a job well done. The &#8220;New
      Super Under Fire&#8221; hammy goes to Derek Ailes.<br>
      <br>
      <em>Tosca</em> -<br>
      The finale of the Tosca Act I Te Deum is a magnificent procession of Supers
      finishing up with a huge silk brocade canopy that glorifies our own Cardinal
      Jim Downey. The procession is precisely timed and due to backstage space
      constraints, the canopy has to be rigged at the last minute. On this particular
      evening when our intrepid canopy bearers hoisted the thing skyward, it
      proceeded to fall apart. One of the front corners came off first and as
      soon as the props person had refastened it, one of the back corners collapsed.
      This was happening as the procession was swiftly moving forward and of
      course there is no turning back. A split second before the guys would have
      had to hold the thing up with their bare hands the opera gods seemed to
      have had their joke and it all came together perfectly. The hammy goes
      to Phillipe Arbeit, Marcel Delgado, David Grace, Al Knoll, and Don Stoddard.<br>
      <br>
      <em>The Flying Dutchman</em> -<br>
      This is a unique award since there were actually no Supers in Flying Dutchman
      at all. Five talented Super women were, however, cast and to the show&#8217;s
      great loss, were cut even before rehearsals began. These talented women
      receive the hammy this year because even though they were cut from Dutchman,
      their names appeared in the program for Le Grand Macabre. This just illustrates
      the point that real Supers always find a way. This Hammy goes to Kimberley
    Thompson, Lisa Gelling, Ursula Grunfeld, Marie McNulty, and Karen Horvath.</p>
