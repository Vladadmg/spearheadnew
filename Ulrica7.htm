        Behavior </strong></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><img src="images/sku2368.jpg" width="333" height="400"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">It 
        was one of those moments all Supers dream about. The lights went down 
        at the October 10th performance of <em>The Barber of Seville </em> and 
        the ominous voice of the Stage Manager came over the sound system, striking 
        fear into the opera-goers' hearts… </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">“At 
        tonight's performance of <em>The Barber of Seville </em> the role of (pause) 
        'The Notary' will be played by <strong>Steve Nye</strong>”. </font></p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">They 
        were announcing a Super substitution from the stage! Never before had 
        we heard the like (imagine “At tonight's performance the role of the third 
        lackey on stage left will be played by…”). </font></p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">The 
        sole Super role in <em>Barber </em> is that of the Notary (towards the 
        end of Act Two) and is usually played by <strong>Robert Dickinson</strong>. 
        Robert has his own dressing room on the second floor and an asterisk after 
        his name in the cast list (indicating a San Francisco Opera debut). Steve 
        is the cover and did a fabulous job as the bemused character who follows 
        Don Basilio into the Bauhaus house to perform a marriage which ends in 
        typical Rossini mayhem. Although it was hard to know where to look for 
        much of this production, Steve, in top hat and frock coat, held his own 
        as the comic foil throughout this lengthy scene, joining the principals 
        for curtain calls and bows. Bravo! </font></p>
      <hr>
      <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Women 
        Supers who received the call to audition for the role of the woman standing 
        on her head on a Vespa while having her legs shaved will be interested 
        to know that the part was taken by an acrobat. That would be <strong>Teresa 
        Lonsbury</strong></font><font size="2">, who gets to spend a lot of time, 
        in a range of genders, riding around on the stage with heartthrob <strong>Nathan 
        Gunn </strong> on said Vespa. She does eventually get to wear a stunning 
        emerald green taffeta dress, which suits her much more than the aviator's 
        cap and 5 o'clock shadow she starts out with. She, too, was back for well-deserved 
        curtain calls. Brava!</font></p>
      <hr>
      <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">While 
        delivering the <em>Barber </em> opening night candies on “Total Recall” 
        election night, Ulrica kept bumping into Rossini comedienne (and personal 
        favorite since the time we shared the stage in the 1991 <em>Elektra</em>) 
        mezzo <strong>Catherine Cook</strong>, also leaving little piles of sweeties 
        for the cast and crew. A nice gesture!</font></p>
      <hr>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;"><font size="2">The audience 
        for the second <em>Barber </em> performance was crawling with Supers. 
        <strong>John R. (“Film”) Martin</strong>, feeling much better after his 
        recent surgery, was ushering and looking great: He hopes to be back on 
        stage later this season. <strong>Karen </strong>and <strong>Albert Goodwyn 
        </strong> were there too. Albert has just finished stage-managing 64 performances 
        of the play <em>Shakespeare's R&amp;J</em> at the New Conservatory Theater. 
        <strong>Charlie Lichtman </strong> (also in the audience) caught one of 
        the final performances of the play and was very impressed. In the lobby 
        it was a delight to bump into Opera Mom <strong>Pat Beresford</strong>, 
        in town for a few minutes. She is still traveling from opera house to 
        opera house, so expect to see an update of “Around the World with Pat 
        Beresford” any day now.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2">Speaking 
        of one-super operas: If you were sitting in the house-left section for 
        any of the performances of <em> Pagliacci </em> then you would have missed 
        <strong>Tom Carlisle </strong>'s sterling performance as a gesticulating 
        priest trying to keep his over-excited schoolboys under control. Super 
        <strong>Jim Downey </strong> made a point of occupying a vacant house-right 
        seat for the second part of the verismo double bill in order to see that 
        super moment. </font></p>

        Hammy acceptance speeches. But as you tearfully thank your agents and

        pig you are clutching to your breast. That handcrafted pig will be the 
        work of long time Super <strong>John Janonis</strong>. <img src="images/Jononis.jpg" width="191" height="245" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="right">John 
        has been making the Hammies for longer than anyone can remember and tries 
        to tie the pig's accessories in with one of that season's operas. As I 
        am so closely identified with the Marschallin it was appropriate that 
        my first Hammy was a tribute to <em>Der Rosenkavalier</em>, with the pig 
        holding a tiny silver rose. John isn't supering this season but has promised 
        to bring home-made dolmas to the <a href="events/events.html" target="_blank">next 
        bake sale </a>so watch out for them. When you are next in downtown San

            <p><font size="2">Culture Vulture 
        Ulrica was out and about this weekend, not only at the <em>Barber </em> 
        performance but also doing San Francisco Artists' Open Studios. While 
        reading the <em>Bay Area Reporter </em> at the beauty salon she spotted 
        the work of Super (and SFO Production Department employee) <strong>Michael 
        Schoenig</strong>. So she made a beeline (bumping into <strong>Andrea 
        Kohlruss</strong> <em>en route</em>, playing tour guide to Austrian friends) 
        to 19th and Collingwood where Michael was exhibiting his very accomplished 
        Realist paintings for the third consecutive year with the Gay and Lesbian 
        Artists Alliance. Michael returned to art school in 1998 in his native 
        upstate New York and has been painting ever since, sadly leaving little 
        time to carry spears. He was exhibiting two spectacular allegorical pieces 
        based on the iconic Saint Sebastian as well as a series of beautiful, 
        though stark, seascapes and desert landscapes. Particularly striking was 
        a painting of islands off the Brittany Coast that Michael had visited 
        and where Chateaubriand de Chateaubriand is buried (that would be author 
        Fran&ccedil;ois-Ren&eacute;, who died in 1848, not the steak). There was 
        also a stunning still life with contrasting textures of basket weave and 
        red silk that Ulrica might have been tempted to buy, had it not had a 
        little red dot at its side. Check out Michael's nicely presented <a href="http://www.mschoenig.com/" target="_blank">website.</a></font></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><font size="2">Also 
        exhibiting with GLAA this past weekend was former Super (is there such 
        a thing or, as Carrie Bradshaw might wonder, “If we've ever carried a 
        spear for someone does that mean we'll be super all our lives?”) <strong>Barry 
        Nielsen</strong>. Barry was exhibiting his homoerotic works, many using 
        an acrylic paint that responds to ultraviolet light, which gives them 
        an interesting spatial quality and eerie glow: wonderful after-dark paintings 
        for up-all-night viewing. </font></p>
      <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Barry had a lot 
        of Supering experience in the late 80s and early 90s, appearing in many 
        operas including televised productions of <em>L'Africaine </em> with <strong>Placido 
        Domingo </strong>and <strong>Shirley Verrett</strong>, <em>Dangerous Laisons 
        </em> with <strong>Flicka </strong> and <strong> Thomas Hampson</strong>, 
        and the 1988 <em>La Boh&eacute;me </em> with <strong>Pavarotti </strong>and<strong> 
        Mirella Freni</strong>.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Also doing artful 
        things is Super <strong>Michael Strickland </strong>. Check out his photo-essays 
        being featured every Monday evening on “Foto Tales” from 6 – 6:30 p.m. 
        on Channel 29 (Public Access cable channel in San Francisco). Michael 
        spent a whole year taking photographs and each week shows seven days worth 
        of photos, many with an operatic theme, in a slideshow format. Michael 
        has returned to supering with a bang, appearing in this year's <em>Don 
        Carlos </em> and <em>Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk</em>. Welcome back, Michael!

      <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Anyone who supered 
        in the early 90s will fondly remember Michael's t-shirt designs, including 
        the <em>Don Carlo </em> “Throw Another Heretic on the Barbie, Bishop” 
        as well as the “Slaves of <em>Elektra</em>,” which a close friend informs 
        me is still in the t-shirt collection of <strong><a href="http://www.parterre.com/joneshome.HTM" target="_blank">Dame Gwyneth Jones.</a><br>

      <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Supers <strong>Marcel 
        Delgado, Charlie Lichtman </strong> and <strong>Andrew Korniej </strong> 
        answered a recent call for extras for a community-based movie being shot 
        in San Francisco's Mission District and called, appropriately “The Mission 
        Movie.” The film follows several story lines based on the lives of Mission 
        characters and is tentatively scheduled for a January release. Watch for 
        the super trio in the war protest scene, holding a giant blue man-puppet. 
        Puppet holding seems to be a specialty for Charlie, who held up a bride 
        doll in this past summer's <em>Faust</em>, and is holding a heretic doll 
        (known as “Zippy the Heretic” or “Sponge Bob Sackcloth Pants”) in <em>Don 
        Carlo</em>. </font></p>

        another edition of Ulrica draws to a close she realizes that she has failed 
        to mention actor and Super <strong>Grove Wiley </strong>in the column 
        and doesn't want him to feel neglected so “Hello, Grove!” </font></p>
