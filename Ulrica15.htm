        the summer season gets underway Ulrica is once again in her element gathering 
        tidbits of gossip as if they were roses in bloom. </font></p>

        news of all is that blue-eyed director/AD <strong>Mark Streshinsky</strong> 
        is be about to make his SFO debut as a Super waiter in one or more of 
        the upcoming <em>La Boh&egrave;me</em>s. So far Mark has steadfastly refused 
        to get pie on his face but has shown some talent for the plate tossing 
        that has been somewhat unpredictable this time around… Rumour has it that 
        the matin&eacute;e performance on <a href="events/bohemesale/bohemebakesale.html">Bake 
        Sale Day</a>, Sunday, June 13th, will be Mark's official debut. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">The 
        final dress of <em>Boh&egrave;me</em> on Tuesday evening was quite a giddy 
        affair with a house full of high school students having a good time in 
        the upper levels, and a festive atmosphere amongst the Supers cashing 
        in their lightwalking credits down in the Orchestra Sides. But why, if 
        Supers in a show are offered the chance to bring a guest to their final 
        dress, are those names not included on the guest list? There were several 
        instances of Supers' friends almost being turned away and/or being banished 
        to Balcony Rear… </font></p>

        night went swimmingly, with <strong>John F. “Digital” Martin</strong> 
        taking one of the waiter parts again (filling in for <strong>Scott Sanford</strong> 
        who was in New Orleans planning his October wedding)… John F. got off 
        to shaky start (but a surefire Hammy nomination) as the table he carries 
        on during the scene change got tangled up in some wires <em>attached to 
        the set</em>! Disaster was skillfully averted and everything went flawlessly 
        after that… Back in Wigs and Makeup a member of the women's chorus was 
        overheard saying “the waiters were superb tonight” to which Ulrica adds 
        a hearty “Hear, Hear”… After their parts were done the entire Super contingent 
        headed over to Jardiniere for much needed drinks... </font></p>

        The new cast is vigorous, exciting and singing fabulously. With new staging

        amongst the men of the SFO chorus. Her diamond-encrusted, torn-at-the-knee 
        D&amp;G jeans and a series of sky-scraping high-heeled shoes have been 
        of particular interest, it seems… No idea when the <em>60 Minutes </em>episode

      <h1 class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">All 
        About Ljuba </font></h1>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Anna's
          Musetta is a real show stopper, but Ulrica <img src="funstuff/images/Ljuba3.jpg" width="175" height="165" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="left">feels
          she must take a moment and pay homage to the <em>wildest </em>Musetta
          of them all, “sexy Bulgarian” 
        soprano <strong>Ljuba Welitsch</strong>. OTT Ljuba came on the international
         scene in the late 40s in a Dali-designed <em>Salome</em> at Covent Garden
        and shortly thereafter made her Met debut as the scorching-est Judaen
        princess ever to hit that stage. Tickets were among the most sought after
        in New York theatrical history. (Ljuba parties on&nbsp;but Callas disapproves,
        above).</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">In
           1952 Met General Manager Rudolf Bing reluctantly agreed to let Ljuba
          sing 
        Musetta in one performance only; as punishment to soubrette Patrice Munsel
           who was threatening to leave the company unless she was given some
          Mimis 
        to sing. No sooner had he “grimly agreed” to Patrice's demands than he
        shrewdly called La Welitsch and offered her the Musetta. Knowing<img src="/funstuff/images/ljubaandK.jpg" width="114" height="212" align="right"> she
        would
        be horribly upstaged, Patrice “changed her mind and virtually fled the
         country” leaving <em>verismo </em> pro Dottie K (Dorothy Kirsten, in
         plaid, with Ljuba) to take over. According to Bing, Ljuba “delivered
         a performance which could be said to define the difference between a
         mischievous
         courtesan
         and a raucous 
        whore.” Ljuba jumped on tables, forced Marcello to carry her on his shoulders,
         elbowed people out of the way and “just behaved shockingly”* </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Much 
        like the performance where a leaping Tosca bounced back above the castle 
        ramparts, <em>everybody </em>has since claimed to have been at that performance 
        of <em>Boh&egrave;me</em>. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Ljuba
           crashed and burned vocally before long, sadly ending her operatic
          days 
        as the Duchess of Krackenthorp in Donizetti's <em>La Fille du Regiment. 
        </em> But for a short time she blazed brilliantly and her unforgettable
         Salome exists in live recordings (<a href="/funstuff/assets/Ljuba1.mp3">clip1</a>) and her temperament
        revealed in the shouting 
        match at the end of this studio recording of Mahler's <em>Ruckert Lieder
        </em>(<a href="/funstuff/assets/Ljuba.mp3">clip2</a>).

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">On 
        the Faust Project front, the SFO premiere of Busoni's <em><a href="http://sfopera.com/03_castcrew.asp?operaseasonid=207" target="_blank">Doktor Faust</a>        </em> could be the summer season's most revelatory offering. Reports are 
        in that the wedding scene costumes and wigs look “very drag queen” and 
        we in San Francisco would know that. The set is a bipolar spread encompassing 
        a dark and dowdy church hall and a stark, sterile neon lit laboratory. 
        Ulrica wonders if any audience members will show up expecting to hear 
        the <em>Jewel Song. </em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Lightwalkers 
        reveal that the <em>Vixen</em> set follows a similar postwar “Fedoras” 
        aesthetic with its chicken guano–covered stalls and dank, underground 
        train station waiting room, but by all accounts it is an entirely charming 
        and winsome piece featuring our beloved chorus women taking on the roles 
        of exploding chickens. For the context on that you'll have to <a href="http://sfopera.com/03_castcrew.asp?operaseasonid=208" target="_blank">see

        (see above), Supers were out in force, mingling with the performing Adler

        Peter Strummer, graciously there to applaud his younger colleagues. Vocal 
        highlights included <strong>Nikki Einfeld</strong>'s courageous and accomplished 
        <em>O luce di quest'anima</em>, <strong>Christina Lamberti</strong>'s

        at SFO over the years that we all hope it can be returned to her in spades 
        during this challenging time. It will take a lot to defeat that redoubtable 
        spirit of hers and I'm sure I speak for all of the Supers when I wish 
        Pat strength and good health. Ulrica did notice, however, that no matter
