        a kick from a popular out-going ASM at the last <em>Don Carlos </em> bake 
        sale? Said ASM was apparently not amused by some jostling. ‘Twas all in 
        fun and things could have been worse: the jostled one could have been 
        Lotte Lenya's Rosa Klebb. </font></p>

        acrobats in the January performances of <em>Il Barbiere</em>? Ulrica is 
        of the opinion that with Figaros as good looking as this season's there's 
        quite enough to watch during “Largo Al Factotum” anyway <em>. </em></font></p>

        Zoning </font></h1>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">On 
        a recent trip to Washington, DC and Baltimore, committee member <strong>Andrew 
        Korniej </strong> and partner Chuck Yenson went on a pilgrimage to find 
        deceased soprano <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/php/famous.php?page=name&firstName=Rosa&lastName=Ponselle%20" target="_blank">Rosa 
        Ponselle</a>. While driving around the massive Druid Ridge Cemetery in 
        Baltimore they felt lost and stopped to ask directions to the main office 
        from a couple of gravediggers. When they said they were looking for Rosa 
        the diggers said “Well she's right here, we'll let you in” and opened 
        the doors to the crypt where one of the greatest sopranos of the twentieth 
        century and her sister Carmella are spending eternity. After paying their 
        respects and playing her superb recording of “O Nome Tutelar” on the car 
        CD player they left the by-now-eerily-deserted, scene. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">As 
        if this spooky encounter weren't enough they then went on to nearby Stevenson, 
        Maryland, in search of Rosa's fabled home, Villa Pace. Again lost and 
        clueless they stopped in at a small college campus and asked for help 
        at the library desk “Why it's just across the street,” came the reply. 
        Not seeing the celebrated wrought-iron gate decorated with the opening 
        notes of <em>La Forza Del Destino </em>'s “Pace Pace Mio Dio” they cautiously 
        drove up the drive to the white cruciform villa (modeled after Rosa's 
        costume in the U.S. premiere of <em>Forza </em> at the Met in 1918 in 
        which Rosa made her operatic debut alongside Enrico Caruso). While furtively 
        photographing the scene Andrew and Chuck were greeted by the current and 
        gracious lady of the house who invited them to tour the grounds and dished 
        about the mismanagement of the Ponselle Estate and Foundation. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Rosa 
        was most certainly guiding these two on their mission. </font></p>

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">From 
        <strong>Twisted Sister </strong>comes an account of how former SFO employee 
        Chris Bergen was walking alone in London when he heard a rich mezzo-soprano 
        voice calling his name. He turned around and came face to face with <em>Dead 
        Man Walking</em>'s Singing Nun, the fabulous Susan Graham, carrying a 
        huge Burger King with fries and apparently not counting her calories…</font><font size="2">Another 
        Burger Queen from the <em>DMW </em> cast, apparently, is legendary mezzo 
        Frederica von Stade. As Supers <strong>Michael Strickland </strong> and 
        <strong>Charlie Lichtman </strong> were chowing down at a Civic Center 
        diner called Flipper last week, in walked Flicka with an unidentified 
        companion and ordered a hamburger. She passed on the fries, opting for 
        a salad instead. &nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font size="2"> </font></p>

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Speaking 
        of That Lady from Mtsensk, how nice to see Ann Panagulias back on the 
        SFO stage. For many Supers Ann was their first leading lady, as Natasha 
        in the 1991 <em>War and Peace</em>. She was superb in the 1989 production 
        of <em>Lulu </em> but was inexplicably absent from major SFO roles after 
        <em>W&amp;P</em>; possibly more to do with the prejudices of the previous 
        administration than with her prodigious gifts. Apparently Ann realized 
        she was being taken off the roster when she noticed that her photo had 
        been removed from a previous General Director's office wall. Welcome back 
        Ann! </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Another 
        Ann, Ruth Ann Swenson, seems to be singing everywhere but here these days 
        and kudos to her for touting the virtues of the criminally undervalued 
        opera <em>La Sonnambula </em> in the current issue of <em>Opera News </em>. 
        Ulrica still bemoans missing, by one day, a performance of Swenson singing 
        Amina at Lisbon's San Carlos Theater in 1999. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">The
           latest &quot;Opera Schmooze&quot; also offered a very nice review
           of SFO's 
        <em>Mother of Us All</em>. Check it out. No mention of the Super children,
        of course. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;"><font size="2">And
           apologies to <em>fashionista </em> Brady Hamilton for misidentifying
           his  party outfit as Prada. It was D &amp; G!  Continuing
           incomprehensibly with this train of thought, everyone knows that Ulrica
           is a great admirer of certain supernumerary nipples but she found
           this
           illustration
           in the
           current issue of <em>Esquire</em>&nbsp;entirely too&nbsp;confusing:</font></p>

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Finally, 
        Happy Birthday to the artist who elevated <em>Sonnambula</em>'s composer 
        Vincenzo Bellini from a &nbsp; mid-twentieth century low, the great Maria 
        Callas. Maria would have been 80 years old this past December 2nd. </font></p>
