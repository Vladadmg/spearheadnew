        Much for a Good Time?</strong><br>
      or<br>
      <strong>The Financial Truth about the Super Party</strong>	<br>
      by Priscilla Lore
      <br>
      <br>
      It&#8217;s never too early to
      start planning the next Super Party, and your Committee has already been
      discussing who, what, where, when. The last party was such a success that
      we want to make sure everyone has just as good a time this year&#8212;or
      even better. But, along with the rave reviews of the 2005 party, we heard
      several objections to having to pay $5 to attend. With all the bake sales,
      the garage sale, and donated items, we were asked, shouldn&#8217;t the
      party be free? Well, yes, it should&#8212;but, alas, it&#8217;s not possible.
      The Committee thought it a good idea to break down the actual costs for
      the party well in advance of the next one because, frankly, we&#8217;re
      expecting to have to raise the cost of admission from $5 to maybe $10 or
      even more. Bear with me and I&#8217;ll explain why.<br>
      <br> 
      <strong>It may look like a balanced
      budget&#8230;</strong><br>
      <br>
      <img src="committeeimages/partyincome.jpg" width="363" height="206" align="left">In 2005 we raised more than $800 from the garage sale, nearly $3,000 from the
five bake sales, and $750 from the $5 admission for 150 partygoers. That added
up to $4518.50 raised and we were bucks up for a while&#8212;not bad! Party expenses,
however, made short work of that: more than $4,100 for the catering (Intimate
Catering&#8212;weren&#8217;t
they great?), $225 for the beautiful Golden Gate Yacht Club (and on a pretty,
clear evening&#8212;thanks over and over again to <strong>Sharon Castle</strong>), another $75
for the busboys, and nearly $60 for soft drinks. This added up to $4,521.53,
or
an actual cost of $30.10 per person&#8212;we broke even, and that&#8217;s with
the $5 charge. Looks perfect, right? EXCEPT that several critical items were
donated
last year and <img src="committeeimages/partyexpenses.jpg" width="365" height="205" align="left">we can&#8217;t count on those donations in our plans for 2006. <br>
<br>
<strong>&#8230;
But we&#8217;d be lost without donations</strong> <br>
<br>
Included in the donations were bottled
water, bar snacks before dinner, the beautiful flowers and candles, and the printing
of the programs. Our talented entertainment&#8212;<strong>Matthew Trevi&ntilde;o</strong>, <strong>Brian
Frutiger</strong>,
and accompanist <strong>Donald White</strong>&#8212;were each paid $100, which
was generously
donated;
additional Yacht Club expenses of $500 were also donated. Also, to cut costs,
we served wine left from last year&#8217;s party (cellared in the fabled Opera
House caves). NOT TO MENTION the donation of time, energy, and creativity on
the part of everyone involved. (Cost breakdown was provided by <strong>Barbara
Sherman </strong>in a report she presented to the Committee and graphs were created
by <strong>Paul Szczesiul</strong>.) <br>
<br> 
As you can see, the Committee did
everything
possible to keep costs down and still arrange a rockin&#8217; party. Bear in
mind that these are not the only expenditures the Committee makes over the year.
We also provide candies for supers on opening night of their show, pay modest
website expenses to maintain SpearheadNews.com, reimburse <strong>Tom Carlisle</strong> for maintaining
the elaborate and beautiful super scrapbooks, as well as purchase postage for
the few mailed items, and keep a good store of supplies for the bake sales (plates,
utensils,
etc.). With all these expenses we&#8217;re not exactly rolling in dough. For
the 2006 party, we are expecting the cost for catering, which is the bulk of
the
outlay, to go up. We also anticipate cost increases in most other areas as well. <br>
<br>
<strong>So where&#8217;s the money going to come from?</strong><br>
<br>
It became clear during the Committee&#8217;s party postmortem meeting that we
need to raise more funds to keep the party at the level we enjoyed so much last
year.
Among our choices are to have more bake sales, charge more per item at the bake
sales, raise the price of admission to the party, and solicit supers for additional
donations. <br>
<br>
<strong>See why we have to charge admission to the party?</strong><br> 
<br>
Even if you think you shouldn&#8217;t have to pay it, you have to admit that
$5
for an evening of talented singers, great food, beautiful setting, and the company
of fellow supers all dressed up (some in costume!) was a small price to pay.
Well
worth twice that, if not more. <br>
