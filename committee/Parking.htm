        and Safety</font></p>
            <div> 
        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Parking and safety in the 
          areas around the Opera House have become of increasing concern, according 
          to personal experiences of Supers and&nbsp;statistics issued by the 
          SFPD (maps below). Dan Ashley of</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;"><a href="http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/" target="_blank">Channel 
          7</a> News is reporting on the problem and has interviewed Supers and 
          chorus members who have experienced car break-ins while at the House 
          for a news&nbsp;item that is scheduled to air at <strong>11 pm</strong> 
          on <strong>Friday, November 10th</strong>.</p>
        <p><font size="2"><strong>(update - see Channel 7 News video report <a href="breakinsvideo.html">here</a>)</strong></font></p>
        <div>Meanwhile, <em>The Spearhead</em> would like to offer some strategies 
          for staying safe in the neighborhood, and a parking option for Supers 
          in <em>Carmen</em> and <em>Manon Lescaut</em>.</div>
      </div>
      <p><font size="2"><font style="color:black;"><img width="576" height="445" src="images/clip_image002.jpg"></font></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" style="color:black;">These 
        incident reports were compiled by the SFPD over the summer and show <em>reported 
        </em>incidents of assault, robbery, grand larceny, theft and rape. Capt. 
        Kevin Dillon of Northern Police Station agreed with our concerns and added 
        that “there is <em>no</em> safe place to park in the area adjacent to 
        the Opera House.”</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" style="color:black;"><img width="576" height="437" src="images/clip_image004.jpg"></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" style="color:black;">The 
        entire area must be considered dangerous, but there are two major areas 
        of concern to Supers. The first is the corridor from the BART and Muni 
        stations at Civic Center to the Civic Center Garage. There have been numerous 
        reports of harassment. Supers should continue safe practices such as carpooling, 
        walking or driving friends to their cars or BART, and generally being 
        alert while walking at any time in the area.</font></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0;"><font size="2" style="color:black;">The 
        second is the blocks west of the Opera House. The safety of Supers called 
        to the House after the curtain, when parking spaces in the immediate area 
        are non-existent, is of major concern. Typically the paid lots and meters 
        are filled long before the curtain goes up, and the only options for parking 
        are on the streets west of Gough; according to the police reports these 
        constitute some of the most dangerous blocks in the area. Walking to or 
        from the House, especially unaccompanied or when the streets are empty, 
        poses a serious risk for robbery or assault.</font></p>
      <div>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Break-ins are not just things 
          that happen after dark, either. Bob Ericson and Laurel Winzler have&nbsp;both 
          had their cars broken into during Sunday matinees.&nbsp;Nor does&nbsp;your 
          stuff have to look valuable to be worth breaking a window to get: your 
          gym bag, a shopping bag from a nice store, or even parking change could&nbsp;be 
          very tempting.&nbsp;Be cautious and put&nbsp;<em>everything</em> in&nbsp;your 
          trunk <em>before</em> you leave for the House. We have been warned that 
          cars are often&nbsp;"staked out" when they pull in to park because&nbsp;it's 
          a pretty safe bet for&nbsp;would-be thieves that&nbsp;your car will 
          be&nbsp;left unattended&nbsp;for a couple of hours. </p>
        </div>
      <p><font size="2" style="color:black;">Recently, 
        Super Mike Harvey had the following experience with potentially dangerous 
        crime in the neighborhood:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" style="color:black;"><em>I 
          was parked on McAllister between Franklin and Gough - a half-block from 
          the Opera employee parking lot - and observed a group of young men huddled 
          in the shadows of the housing project near the corner. As I was preparing 
          to drive home, several cars drove up, stopped in the middle of the street 
          opposite the men in the shadows, someone would rush out and pass something 
          to the driver, and the car would pull away to make room for the next 
          customer. It looks like a busy drug dealing spot.</em></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="2" style="color:black;">A 
        sub-committee from the Super Committee approached the Opera House management 
        (April Busch and her boss, Drew Landmesser) about the problem and several 
        points were raised during a meeting on September 12th.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" style="color:black;">Drew 
        had recently moved to San Francisco from Chicago, and was very surprised 
        to see that the Civic Center area is so poorly patrolled and so dimly 
        lit. He hopes to be able to work with the City to rectify this, and is 
        optimistic that Franklin Street can be better illuminated and that security 
        personnel can, at some point in the future, be posted at strategic points 
        from Civic Center Station and the Civic Center Garage to help safeguard 
        pedestrians.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" style="color:black;">However, 
        the Opera management is unwilling to offer free parking to Supers for 
        a variety of reasons and, with the potential development of two of the 
        Company's lots, the situation is unlikely to change. Drew and April have 
        been able to negotiate, on behalf of the Supers, reserved spaces in the 
        secure City-operated Performing Arts Garage on Grove Street. They are 
        not free, but you can reserve a space for the entire run and your $10 
        per performance stipend will be used to pay for it. The advantage to this 
        arrangement is that Supers can guarantee themselves a secure place to 
        park close to the House.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" style="color:black;">This 
        arrangement will be &quot;test run&quot;' during the run-throughs and 
        performances of <em>Carmen</em> and <em>Manon Lescaut,</em> two shows 
        that have late Super call times. Your PSC will provide sign-up sheets 
        to be completed and returned in order to secure a space. Supers in both 
        productions are strongly encouraged to participate in it and to send <a href="mailto:Flaurel1@aol.com">feedback</a> 
        to Committee Member Laurel Winzler. </font></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2" style="color:black;">Following 
        is the official agreement.</font></p>
      <hr>
      <p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2" style="color:black;">OVERVIEW: 
        </font></p>
      <p style="margin-top:0;"><font size="2" style="color:black;">The 
        Company has agreed to work with the Performing Arts Garage (360 Grove 
        Street at Gough) to reserve parking spaces for Supers. The spaces will 
        be paid for out of the compensation of each individual Super who signs 
        up for a space. This pilot program will be implemented during the fall 
        season for <em>Manon Lescaut</em> and <em>Carmen</em>. The success of 
        the program and the demand will be reassessed at the end of the season, 
        and changes may be made at that time.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2" style="color:black;">WHAT 
        IS BEING OFFERED: </font></p>
      <p style="margin-top:0;"><font size="2" style="color:black;">Any 
        Super in <em>Manon Lescaut</em> or <em>Carmen</em> may reserve a parking 
        space in the Performing Arts Garage for stage run-through rehearsals and 
        performances. These spaces will be guaranteed by the PAG, so that late 
        arrivals will still have spaces available. Any Super signing up for a 
        space agrees to waive their $10 stipend for the run-throughs and performances. 
        The reservations will be handled by the Company on behalf of the Supers.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2" style="color:black;">HOW 
        IT WORKS: </font></p>
      <p style="margin-top:0;"><font size="2" style="color:black;">Any 
        Super in the designated shows may request a reserved parking space for 
        all performances, or run-throughs and performances. A parking pass will 
        be issued to that Super, to be presented at the PAG when entering the 
        garage. No specific area will be designated for Super parking, but a space 
        is guaranteed somewhere in the structure.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" style="color:black;">There 
        will not be any option to choose certain dates for the pass: it will be 
        issued for the entire run and compensation will be withheld accordingly. 
        By signing up for a parking space, the Super agrees that they will not 
        receive payment for performances or run-throughs/performances. They will 
        be paid as usual for staging rehearsals. The parking pass may be transferred 
        to another Super by the pass holder, but the pass holder is still responsible 
        for the cost and will have their pay withheld regardless of who ultimately 
        uses the pass. Payments to the pass holder will be withheld for every 
        performance, regardless of whether the pass is used for that performance 
        or not.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2" style="color:black;">HOW 
        TO SIGN UP: </font></p>
      <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2" style="color:black;">The 
        Production Super Captains for <em>Carmen </em> and <em>Manon Lescaut </em> 
        will provide the necessary sign-up form. The Company will then reserve 
        a space for you in the Performing Arts Garage, and will adjust your compensation 
        accordingly. A pass will be issued to you by the Company. </font></p>
