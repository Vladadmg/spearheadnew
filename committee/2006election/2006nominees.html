        This past season I was fortunate to have had two super roles: one in <em>Dr. 
        Atomic</em> as a WAC and the other as the slithering Salamander in <em>Flute 
        for Kids</em>. In the past 3-plus years I have also met many of you doing 
        lightwalking assignments and working at the Gay Pride events. I have a 
        lot of energy and would love to have the opportunity to put it to good 
        use serving on the Super Committee. As a member, I would continue to build 
        on the work that has been done by the existing committee, which would 
        include working with the opera staff to improve opportunities for more 
        super roles, expanded bake sales and once again another GREAT Party.&nbsp;Your 
      consideration and support is appreciated. <br>

        Long-term Super (1989 to present) with 30 productions to my credit, award-winning 
        <em>Spearhead</em> columnist, featured artiste in SFO 2004 <em>La Boheme</em> 
        (highlights televised on <em>60 Minutes</em>) and Super Committee Member 
        from 2001 &#8211; 2004.<br>
        After a two year hiatus I would love to get back onto the Super Committee 
        and be a part of the new developments coming to San Francisco Opera. We 
        are a unique and remarkable group of individuals and I have always been 
        proud to be a part of that group and to be of service in helping make 
        the supering experience enjoyable and memorable. </p>

        I have been a Super since the 1989 fall season when I appeared in <em>Aida</em>. 
        Since that time, I have supered in 17 operas. I have greatly enjoyed this 
        experience and would like to help pass along this special tradition to 
        others. Many of you may know me as the backstage photographer who took 
        your picture in costume and gave you a print. Twice before I have served 
        on the Super Committee, so I know what the demands of this position are. 
        I would like to add my knowledge, experience and expertise to the mix 
        for the upcoming season. With the appointment of David Gockley as the 
        new General Director, we have an excellent opportunity to bring supering 
        back to its &#8220;glory days.&#8221; It would be my pleasure to work 
        for the Supers and to help plan and produce a really good season-closer 
        party. I look forward to seeing all of you in the 2006 &#8211; 2007 season!

        I have been on the Super Committee for one year and really enjoy it. I 
        was the co-chairman of the 2005 Super Party with Paul and it was a &quot;Super&quot; 
        success. I have been active with the S.F. Opera for 8 years and have been 
        a Super three times and a continuous Lightwalker. I am a Matinee Monitor, 
        a docent with Opera aLa Carte at the schools, and a follower giving tours 
        of the Opera House. And as an aside, I founded the Harrisburg Opera Association 
        in Pennsylvania before I moved to California. I would love to continue 
        to serve on the Super Committee to help advance its goals. </p>

      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I would like to have the opportunity 
        for my third and final year as a member of the Super Committee. As a member 
        for the past two years I have been fortunate to work with an outstanding 
        group of talented people to serve our Super community. During this past 
        year, the committee has accomplished a great deal including--<br>
        --Planning and executing all the fundraising events<br>
        --Organizing a terrific Annual Party<br>
        --Conducting a survey of all Supers (results to be published this spring)<br>
        --Maintaining good communication with the San Francisco Opera company 
        during the management transition<br>
        --Increasing the communication with Supers<br>
        --Rewriting the Super Manual (coming this fall)<br>
        And there is still much to do. I hope you give me the opportunity to continue 
        this important work.</p>

        truly love all that the San Francisco Opera represents: music, art, and 
        drama. The Supers that support that effort deserve and have earned the 
        respect of the company. I would work to foster improved conditions:<br>
        1. Work-out space/gym space to use during &quot;down times&quot;<br>
        2. Healthier vending machine options<br>
        3. Some limited access (per production) to film archives so Supers could 
        view themselves, as never before, on stage. </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">I&#8217;ve been a Super at SFO 
        since 1983 (appearing in more than 30 productions), and you can read all 
        about my past supering experiences in the <a href="../../Interviews/interviews.html">interviews 
        section</a> of this website. I served on the Super Committee from 1989 
        &#8211; 1991, and I&#8217;d like to get involved again, as we transition 
        into the new administration, to deal with issues that affect Supers and 
        to take positive steps to improve the supering experience for us all.&nbsp;I&#8217;m 
        concerned about the need for reliable rehearsal schedules, the question 
        of the increased expense and scarcity of safe parking near the Opera House, 
        and overall personal security (especially for Supers who are called or 
        released at off times).&nbsp; With 20 years of perspective on what has 
        and hasn&#8217;t worked in the past, I&#8217;d like to participate in 
        bringing the experience of all Supers to a new level of professionalism 
        and fun.&nbsp;</p>

        would like to serve one final year on your behalf. This would allow me
        the opportunity to work with the others to help in our efforts to implement
        the results of the Super Survey. <br>
        <br>
        Based on your feedback, we will work even harder to keep all Supers informed
        and will work with the House and among ourselves on finding ways to create
        a more Super-friendly atmosphere. It has been my honor to serve you these
      past two years. </p>
