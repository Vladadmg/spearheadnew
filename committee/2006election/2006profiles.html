        My first Super role was in the fall 2003 production of <em>Don Carlos</em>. 
        I actually had two roles: one, the Black Cardinal, pre-set on the Island, 
        and the other, one of four Red Cardinals.<br>

        The most memorable and stirring moment for me was to be a part of the 
        procession for the <em>auto-da-f&eacute;</em><strong> </strong> in <em>Don 
        Carlos</em>. Another special moment was being three feet from <strong>Christine 
        Brewer</strong>'s singing in the prison scene in <em>Fidelio</em>.</font></p>

        I can remember 44, without checking the archive.<br>
        <br>
        <em>What was your favorite costume?</em> <br>
        Without a doubt-- <em>Lulu</em> ! The costume was designed by <strong>Bob 
        Mackie</strong>, gorgeous in every detail - and a perfect fit. I got to 
        wear it both times we did that production.<br>
        <em>What was your favorite your favorite super role?</em> <br>
        I have to go with <em>War and Peace</em>. I had a different role in each 
        of the 2 acts and it was a blast! As a gypsy girl in Act I, I got to caress 
        <strong>Yuri Marusin</strong>'s boots and lick <strong>Phil Skinner</strong>'s 
        thumb, and in Act II I appeared in my undies and a pannier hoop skirt 
        as a French actress fleeing Moscow (with <strong>Carolyn Waugh</strong> 
        and <strong>Laura Claycomb</strong>). During the last performance, the 
        prop crew put a stuffed parrot in my pannier (because it looked like a 
        birdcage) and I went on stage with it!<br>
        <br>

        My riding crop, as the lady-in-waiting to Mathilde in <em>Guillaume Tell</em>.<br>

        <em>What was your favorite costume?</em> <br>
        I was <strong>Ruth Ann Swenson</strong>'s Cousin Jack in <em>The Ballad

        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><em>What was

        One of the two horses in <em>Louise</em>. Because <strong>Rene Fleming</strong>'s 
        daughters saw them in the costume shop and liked them so much, she asked 
        that <strong>Kim Curtis</strong> (the other horse) and I come to her dressing 
        room for photos to send back to New York.<br>
        <br>
        <em>What was your favorite prop?</em><br>
        The rifle that I shot twice in <em>The Pearl Fishers</em>. I got to shoot 
        Zurga, the baritone, which ends the opera.<br>
        <br>
        <em>What is your most memorable opera moment?</em> <br>
        <strong>Lucas Rebston</strong> and I were the two Supers on stage when 
        <strong>Jane Eaglen</strong> sang the immolation scene in <em>G&ouml;tterdammerung</em>. 
        Despite the fact that I was sweating profusely in my rather heavy Teutonic 
        costume, I got goose bumps when she belted out her final aria.</font></p>

        <em>What was your favorite costume?</em> <br>
        Regrettably, the one I never got to wear on stage, when I was the alternate 
        for the three 12-year-old water sprites in <em>Rusalka</em>. They were 
        sequined body suits, knee-length blond wigs, and beautiful make up. But 
        those darned girls never missed a single performance.<br>
        <br>
        <em>What was your favorite role?</em> <br>
        <strong>Deborah Voight</strong>'s Dresser in <em>Ariadne</em>. Lots of 
        action and a &quot;saved the day&quot; moment when they threw bouquets 
        to the ladies at curtain calls, but because of the stage-within-a-stage 
        set, the flowers fell short of the on-stage platform. I cut out of our 
        lineup, ran to the edge of the stage and passed Ms. Voight her flowers, 
        curtsied and went back to the line, maintaining my character. Got a laugh 
        and an extra hand. Covering for stage mishaps is one of my favorite Super 
        duties.<br>
        <br>
        <em>What was your favorite prop?</em><br>
        The fish head that I wore as the <em>Hansel and Gretel</em> Maitre d'. 
        It was also a great role. As an aside, the shoes they bought me to go 
        with the outfit are in the &quot;Wall of Fame&quot; at the Costume Shop 
        (a wall of boxes of shoes worn by stars who are regulars at SFO). Mine 
        were right there next to ones worn by <strong>Fredrica Von Stade</strong> 
        and <strong>Carol Vaness</strong>!<br>
        <br>
        <em>What is your most memorable opera moment?</em><br>
        Hard to decide. So many dear and unsolicited interactions with Opera's 
        singing treasures. One that stands out was when I was the dead King in 
        <em>Parsifal</em>. While I spent 45 minutes in the crypt, great pealing 
        gongs sounded, and the way the sound moved around the space, it was like 
        being in the bottom of the Great Heart of Opera and hearing the blood 
        rush from chamber to chamber! WOW! Then I was hauled out, dragged around 
        and dumped on <strong>Hans Grunheber</strong>. When he dumped me off, 
        it was always a toss-up as to where I would land. One night the curtain 
        came down and I was downstage of it! Oops, what is a dead body to do?
