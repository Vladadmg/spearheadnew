      <p>Last year, I was appointed to the Super Committee without election because there was a vacancy and no one had run to fill it.&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t know what I was getting into, but was persuaded that I could be of service, so I agreed.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad I did.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>I&rsquo;m a fairly inexperienced Super. I&rsquo;ve only been in <em>Carmen</em>, <em>Der Rosenkavalier</em>, and <em>Tannh&auml;user</em>. But those productions have demonstrated something to me. Although I greatly enjoy the opportunity to be a part of SF Opera&rsquo;s productions, I quickly found out that, if cast, I could pretty well kiss off the rest of my life for a relatively short, but intense, period of time. I could do other things, but if called for an additional rehearsal, or if asked to stay late, my &ldquo;job&rdquo; with the Opera became my first priority &ndash; with everything else relegated to whatever time was left over. It became burdensome to have to inform my partner and friends, and other organizations to which I have obligations, that I&rsquo;d have to cancel the plans I had made with them, perhaps months ahead, to show up for unscheduled rehearsals, often merely to end up cooling my heels. This seemed a funny way to run a business &ndash; and I think, in part, SF Opera is a business.</p>
      <p>The issue was not merely that I, who am surely expendable, might not be able to work around this, but that many others &ndash; newer Supers as time goes on &ndash; might also not, limiting the pool of potential Supers, perhaps diminishing the level of Super performance, perhaps affecting the standards of the production.</p>
      <p>Supers play an important role. I&rsquo;m not sure that it is immediately apparent that it&rsquo;s not possible to simply run out the north stage door onto Franklin Street and corral a bunch of competent Supers if need be. I think a more rational schedule &ndash; better known ahead &ndash; will enhance our contribution&nbsp; by enlarging the pool of potential Supers who will be willing to participate.&nbsp; </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Other committee members and I have raised this issue, a subcommittee has been formed, and I was named to the subcommittee. Our work is not complete. We need more time. I&rsquo;d like to ask for your vote so that this issue can be resolved in the manner that will best serve SF Opera.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my goal.</p>

      <p align="left">I am webmaster for <em>The Spearhead</em> and I have the pleasure of posting  all of the backstage photos for each production. Last season I was the designated  photographer (DP) and I made sure that photos with principals were available for printing on Shutterfly.  Whenever I get the opportunity I also enjoy serving as Production Super Captain. <br>
          <br>
        SF Opera is evolving very fast and  the Super Committee needs to work hard  to keep ahead of the changes. I  served on the committee a few years ago and I'd like to return and do what I can to ensure that  Supers are recognized as important contributors to the company's success.</p>

      Simulcasts, cinemacasts, rebroadcasts....This is an exciting time to be a Super and to serve on the Super Committee.  I find working with an art form that is going through so many changes challenging and exciting.   I'd like to put my energy and enthusiasm to work to help SF Opera and the Supers during this time.  It is a rush to see your name in a program and even more exciting to see your name on the big screen.  This year promises to have more opportunity for Supers on the stage and hopefully on the big screen.  <br>
      <br>
      I'd like to see you there!!!      </p>

      <p>I have been a Super since the 1989 fall season when I appeared in <em>Aida</em>. Since that time, I have &ldquo;supered&rdquo; in 17 operas. I have greatly enjoyed this experience and would like to help pass along this special tradition to others.&nbsp; Many of you may know me as the backstage photographer who took your picture in costume and gave you the reprint.&nbsp; Twice before, I have served on the Super Committee so I know what the demands of this position are. I would like to add my knowledge, experience and expertise to the mix for the upcoming season.&nbsp; It would be my pleasure to work with April and the other members of the Committee  to help plan and produce a really good season-closer party.&nbsp; I look forward to seeing all of you in the 2008-2009 season!</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Iam running for the Super Committe because I have found<br>
  supering to be a tremendously rewarding experience and would like to help make it as enjoyable for current Supers as it has been for me.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0;"><br>
  I believe the purpose of the Committee is twofold: to make being a Super a safe, pleasant and efficient experience and to assist the Company in the goal to which we should all be dedicated - presenting world-class opera.</p>

      <p>I'm interested in running for another term on the Committee to deal with several important issues.  First, I'm presently heading a subcommittee that's working with company representatives to discuss casting and scheduling problems from last season, to see how to improve these areas of the supering experience at San Francisco Opera.  Second, as the chairman of last year's Super party, I'm interested in working with the Supers at large to implement suggested changes to the party format to keep it a fresh and fun experience for everyone.</p>

      <p>Presently, I am a member of the Super Committee and wish to serve one more term in order to help finalize the many goals and projects we have undertaken this past year.  Specifically, one of our efforts will be to select and put the finishing touches on several new fund-raising events under consideration: the first envisions a spectacular wine-tasting social, and the second, a possible presence on a PBS television program answering the &quot;pledge&quot; phone lines in Super T-shirts with the entire Super corps getting recognition from this public-spirited event.</p>
      <p>In terms of past accomplishments, just this past month we had a preliminary meeting with the House to make it aware of our concerns about last year's delays in casting and repeated last-minute changes to rehearsal scheduling.  Also, partially out of concerns we expressed, the House has increased compensation for out-of-house staging rehearsals and for dress rehearsals, and has generously agreed to contribute $200 to the Super Committee Fund for the productions that are cinemacast.   This will help to underwrite the cost of the annual Super party.  I hope that you agree with our efforts on your behalf and that you cast one of your votes for me.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Thank You!</p>
