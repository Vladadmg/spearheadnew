        came as a terrible shock to hear that Katherine Brazaitis had been killed 
        in an auto accident.<br>
        <br>
        Having been involved with the opera and ballet for twenty five years, 
        she was one of those people that made supering worthwhile.<br>
        <br>
        She was beautiful and elegant, exuberant and funny, and had an unfaltering 
        enthusiasm for the job of being a Super. Her affection for her co-performers 
        was very clear. She was a warm and welcoming face and made a point of 
        knowing what was happening in our operatic and personal lives.<br>
        <br>
        Katherine&#8217;s exquisite poise and patrician features made her an ideal 
        Renaissance noblewoman, yet she was always game to take on a down-at-the-heels 
        lady-of-the-night, or a mud-encrusted slave in <em>Elektra</em>.<br>
        <br>
        Katherine was a dear, dear person, someone we all looked forward to seeing 
        at our events, and it is our great loss to no longer have her as a member 
        of our community.</font></p>

        multiple <em>Rigoletto</em>s,&nbsp;from the early '80s on and it will 
        be very hard on all of us Supers not to have her there in person. I know 
        she will be there in spirit. Katherine was a commited Super on stage and 
        off, and a lovely person.</font></p>

        are all saddened by the sudden and unexpected death of our dear friend 
        Katherine Brazaitis. She was the best friend you could imagine, with such 
        a positive outlook on life and always upbeat. Dressing Room 8 at the opera 
        house will never be the same and we all miss her terribly. Her husband 
        Joseph told me yesterday that the opera and ballet meant everything to 
        her; she not only loved supering but also made it a point to go and see 
        almost every production from the front of the house.<br>

        to be admired by us all. She was a great actress too. She really loved 
        doing the operas, didn't she?</font></p>

        she managed to negotiate stumps without stumbling (unlike everyone else)

          I have supered with the SF Opera the past 8 years and she was one of

          opera and she loved people. I was deeply saddened today when I heard 
          about her untimely death in the <em>IJ</em>.&nbsp; I wasn't a Super 
          as much as Katherine, but when we got in an opera together, she was 
          so happy that I was in one with her and I was warmly accepted. She was 
          a beautiful person inside and out. The last time that I saw her was 
          at the Christmas Party when she was dressed as a soldier from the <em>Nutcracker</em>.

          Last Wednesday (5/10), as I was backing out my car from my garage on 
          Pacific and Fillmore, I saw a blond woman in the rear-view mirror and 
          I thought, that is Katherine. And indeed it was. She came up to the 
          side of the car telling me that she was waiting for her friend who lived 
          across the street. The friend was going on a trip to Arizona, and Katherine 
          told me she would go along and keep her company. We talked about various 
          things, her recent surgery, the Super garage sale and the opera season 
          to come. Katherine was her usual bubbly self, full of energy and she 
          looked great. I told her so.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

          was on my way to pick up friends to go to a lecture, so we said goodbye, 
          and that we "will see you at the Opera." What a terrible shock when 
          Andrea emailed me with the sad news. I have known Katherine for so many 
          years and have been in several operas with her. She was a wonderful 
          colleague, someone who lit up the day with her sunny and optimistic 
          personality. I will miss her. </font></font></p>

          was one of the most vibrantly alive people I have ever known. She combined 
          a joyous grace and down-to-earth openness that enabled her to play anything 
          from the patrician to the peasant, and play them well. These same qualities 
          made her a treasured friend to all who knew her even briefly. Her determination 
          and courageous spirit were an inspiration to us all. Even though she 
          was taken from us much, much too soon there is one thing you can most 
          definitely say about Katherine &#8212; she <em>lived</em>.<br>

      <div> 
        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The best bit of acting I saw 
          Katherine do was at neither the opera nor the ballet but during the 
          Summer Pops season at the Symphony in 2002, when they were doing a &quot;semi-staged&quot; 
          version of Bernstein's <em>Candide</em>. Patrick Summers was the conductor, 
          and the leads were played by Jason Danieley, Marin Mazzie and Rita Moreno, 
          along with a crew of other accomplished professionals from Broadway 
          and the opera. And there was Katherine, with dialogue, in a series of 
          small parts where she not only held her own against the very starry 
          cast, but was actually one of the highlights of the show. (Her &quot;sheep&quot; 
          was priceless.) <br>
          <br>
          We're all amateur actors with varying degrees of skill, but Katherine 
          was always the gold standard. The fact that she could do so without 
          taking herself very seriously in public was her real gift to all of 
          us. Bye, goddess.<br>

        only mitigating element of Katherine's death was that it was powerful 
        and fast, which it would have to be to take out such a life-force. As 
        Carolyn said, she <em>lived</em>. Reading everyone's remembrances reminds 
        me all over why supering at SFO draws special people and keeps them in 
        the friendly web for decades, lifetimes even. (I think the old-fashioned 
        term is &quot;affinity group.&quot;)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Katherine 
        was in the very first opera in which I supered, <em>Werther</em>, in the 
        mid-80s. They were literally walk-on parts, but she was the first person 
        I noticed who was actually acting in that tiny space and time given to 
        us. That was more than 20 years ago, but, looking at her photos, I realize 
        she never changed: fabulous posture, graceful movements, gorgeous light-filled 
        face, model-slim body perfect for any costume. And she did it through 
        breast cancer and menopause and Delta Air Line's downsizing and the rest 
        of her personal ups and downs we never knew about.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She 
        was a consummate pro, an inspiration and always a hoot to be around. She 
        loved her Joseph, her adopted Bay Area, and she loved being from Ada and 
        going home for visits because she still valued that no-nonsense, pull-up-by-the-bootstraps 
        Oklahoma core. I am comforted to hear that Traude had that last chance 
        encounter. I will be thinking of you all on the 24th.</font></p>

      <div><font size="2">La</font><font size="2">st fall I was in <em>Norma</em> with Katherine --
          she was the most poised and&nbsp;elegant of the five of us Druid priestesses, as well as 
        the most&nbsp;experienced Super. On opening night in the dressing room 
        she said&nbsp;with a laugh that no matter how many operas and ballets 
        she had&nbsp;supered in, she was never identifiable in any of the photos 
        that&nbsp;showed up in the paper or brochures or programs. An elbow, part 
        of a&nbsp;costume, the person she was standing behind -- these were all 
        that she&nbsp;could point out to people as to who and where she was in 
        the show.&nbsp;She thought she'd end her super career always just cropped 
        out of the&nbsp;published photo. </font></div>

      <div>And then, two days later, the <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/10/25/DDGHTFCHCP1.DTL" target="_blank">review</a> 
        came out in the <em>Chronicle</em>.&nbsp;Right there on the first page
        of the Datebook section was a <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/object/article?f=/c/a/2005/10/25/DDGHTFCHCP1.DTL&o=0" target="_blank">big 
        photo</a>&nbsp;taken during "Casta diva," and there, fully lit, facing 
        the&nbsp;audience, looking soulful and beautiful and gazing up at the 
        soprano,&nbsp;right in the center of the picture, next to Norma a little 
        to her&nbsp;right, was our Katherine. At last!&nbsp; Here's to you, super 
        sister -- now&nbsp;everyone, even people who have never met you, will
        know you're a star. </div>
      <br>
      <div>I'll miss you, </div>

        Katherine was and will always be a bright light to me. Thank
