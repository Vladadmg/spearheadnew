      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">by 
        Tom Reed<em>, Loooong-time Second Tenor with the San Francisco Opera Chorus 
        </em> </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><font size="2">In 
        the wonderful, wacky world of opera, men's voices are divided into several 
        categories: Tenors, Baritones and Basses. Right? Right. There are also 
        a few aberrations like Countertenors and Male Sopranos, but basically, 
        that's it. So what exactly is a Second Tenor? I mean, we've all heard 
        of them, right? But has anyone ever actually heard one sing? We can all 
        name the famous &quot;Three Tenors,&quot; but has anyone ever heard of 
        a &quot;Three Second Tenors&quot; concert? Can anyone think of a single 
        famous Second Tenor? </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><font size="2">Secondtenordom 
        is a very choral condition. The problem with choral composers is that 
        they love to divide their choruses into four parts: Soprano, Alto, Tenor 
        and Bass. But because composers generally were forced to take years and 
        years of piano lessons as children, they tend to do their choral composing 
        on the piano. Less evolved composers write four-part harmonies for choruses, 
        but the really good composers, the ones with the big egos, love to show 
        off by writing eight-part choruses. That way they can utilize eight fingers 
        at a time on the keyboard, and only waste two. So in the left hand you've 
        got the men: Bass, Baritone, (?), and Tenor. But what do you call the 
        part between Baritone and Tenor? Composers could have given this new section 
        its own name, like Baritenor or Tenortone, or even made up something completely 
        unique like &quot;Mellotone.&quot; But remember, composers are egotists. 
        They have no respect for people who can't reach the highest or lowest 
        notes, so they called them &quot;Second Tenors&quot; as a form of humiliation. 
        </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><font size="2">So 
        Second Tenors are saddled with the reputation of being &quot;the other 
        Tenors.&quot; People tend not to notice them. Conductors never even mention 
        them unless there is a problem that needs to be blamed on some section. 
        Conductors know better than to tell any of the women that they've made 
        a mistake. There's certainly no point in correcting the Basses or Baritones, 
        because it won't make any difference. And telling a First Tenor that he 
        made a mistake could easily lead to mutiny. So why not just blame it on 
        the Seconds? They're docile and completely lacking in ego. They already 
        feel depressed and guilty, so why not? But is this reputation completely 
        deserved? </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><font size="2">Even 
        the most egotistical composers sometimes get lazy and switch to four-part 
        choral harmonies. When that happens, all the Tenors get lumped together. 
        That means that the Seconds have to sing the same high notes that the 
        Firsts sing. Second Tenors are the only ones aware of this little-known 
        fact. The Firsts are too proud of their high notes to ever imagine that 
        a lowly Second is singing them too, and none of the other sections care 
        what the Seconds do. It's one of opera's best-kept secrets. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><font size="2">For 
        example, take the opera <em>Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk </em> by Shostakovich. 
        There's a choral entrance in which the Tenors enter the stage singing 
        about a crocodile. Actually they're comparing their boss to a crocodile 
        -- a very Russian thing to do. The Russian word for crocodile is &quot;krokadilitsa.&quot; 
        All of the Tenors, both First and Second, must sing up to a fortissimo 
        High B flat. (That's a “High B-flat,” not a “High B, flat.”) Keep in mind 
        that a High B-flat is almost a High C, which is considered a &quot;money 
        note&quot; by First Tenors. If there is any doubt that the Seconds are 
        singing the high note, one only need to watch their expressions. The First 
        Tenors (who are always the first to enter) appear almost overly confident, 
        and usually make some unnecessary expansive gesture as they reach the 
        top. The Seconds, on the other hand, are the ones lagging behind, looking 
        a bit worried and constricted. Note too that the Seconds utilize 100% 
        of their facial muscles as they reach the climax of the word &quot;Kro 
        - ka - DEEEEEEE - leee - tsa!&quot; The Firsts don't bat an eye except 
        to turn to the audience afterward and smile. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">So 
        if Second Tenors can, and sometimes do sing almost up to a High C, shouldn't 
        they be treated with the same respect as every other section of the chorus? 
        Shouldn't they have their own name? The answer is: Who cares about the 
        chorus? Who's the STAR Tenor?</font></p>
