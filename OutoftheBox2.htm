        &quot;I am an international TV star! OK, I am exaggerating a little. I 
        have to admit my star is not so big. In fact you would have to find it 
        with the Hubble Telescope. But I did just finish filming a supporting 
        role in a Japanese TV show. For those of you not in the biz, a “supporting 
        role” means that my name appears in the credits and that the part was 
        integral to the story. It was only a one-day gig but it was a great experience. 
        This was a big step up for me as I spent about 8 hours with cameras in 
        my face delivering real lines. Too bad they are dubbing my voice into 
        Japanese and the show will never be seen in America . </font></p>
      <font size="2">&nbsp; </font> 
      <p style="margin-top:0;"><font size="2">&quot;The name of the show is <em>World 
        Stunning News</em> and it features reenactments of unusual news stories 
        from around the world. The title of this episode was 'The Girl in the 
        Box,' a horrible news story that you may remember from the 80's. What 
        happened was that a young girl by the name of Colleen Stan was captured 
        and held as a sex slave for 7 years by Cameron Hooker and his wife. Most 
        of the time, they kept her in a coffin-size box under their bed. It was 
        based on the book <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ns2/phoenixbookreviews/Reviews/PerfectVictim.html" target="_blank">Perfect 
        Victim - The Girl in the Box</a>. </font></p>

        played Colleen Stan's father. We spent most of the day filming in a beautiful 
        home located in the hills above the San Francisco airport, which had a 
        spectacular view of the bay. (Too bad my pretend home was so much better 
        than my real home.) I filmed scenes with actors playing my wife, my daughter 
        (Colleen's sister), Hooker, Colleen and a police detective. Believe it 
        or not, Cameron Hooker once took Colleen Stan home for a day visit about 
        two years after she disappeared. Most of the filming revolved around the 
        visit. As incredible as it sounds, Colleen did not tell her parents what 
        had happened and voluntarily went back with Cameron to be a slave. That 
        is real brainwashing. </font></p>
      <p align="left" class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">&quot;The 
        set was a hilarious experience even though the subject was so serious. 
        If you saw <em>Lost in Translation</em>,<em> </em>it was just like that 
        scene in the movie. Imagine a room full of Japanese crew members with 
        four American actors. The Americans didn't speak any Japanese and only 
        two of the crew spoke any English at all—very badly. The director had 
        to pantomime his instructions while the interpreter told us in broken 
        English what to do. The director and staff would have unintelligible arguments 
        for several minutes; then the interpreter would say something like 'turn 
        you head to the left.' Repeat this scene over and over again. It is all 
        we actors could do to not bust out laughing. </font></p>

        was the first job I have had in a long time: Even the film industry is 
        suffering from a recession and they haven't shot as many movies lately. 
        I consider acting a hobby anyway. Let's hope this means the prospects 
        for a real 'day job' are getting better.&quot;</font> </p>

        </em>He writes, &quot;The fact that I have been in 12 SFO productions 
        gave me the acting experience and confidence to take on this role. Acting 
        before a camera crew is easy compared with the pressure of a live performance 
        before 3,000 of America's finest. At least when you&nbsp;make a mistake&nbsp;on 
        camera you can just do it again. On stage every take has to be perfect.&quot;</font></p>
