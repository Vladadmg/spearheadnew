        <p align="left" class="spearhead" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong><font size="2"><em>War 
          and Peace</em></font></strong> was a momentous event in the history 
          of the San Francisco Opera, indeed in the annals of all opera worldwide. 
          Robert Commanday, writing in the <em>Chronicle</em> on September 9, 
          1991, said, &#8220;Prokofiev&#8217;s epic <em>War and Peace</em>&#8212;that 
          vivid flashback to two convulsions in Russia&#8217;s turbulent past, 
          the wars of 1812 and 1939&#8212;was introduced here Saturday night by 
          the San Francisco Opera. The grandness of the production&#8212;with 
          its 73 roles and cast of hundreds&#8212;was set off in greater relief 
          by wonderful strokes of chance. The production&#8217;s appearance at 
          this epochal moment catches the audience at its deepest, most sympathetic 
          awareness of Russia and the agonies of its history.&#8221;<br>
          <br>
          He was referring to the heady, world-shaking events of those days. On 
          Sunday, August 18th, Gorbachev was ousted, and troops were ordered to 
          head for Moscow, in an eerie re-enactment of events in the opera. The 
          ultra-right-wing Gang of Eight was attempting a coup. It failed, but 
          it had considerable results: Yeltsin declared the era of Communism over 
          and suspended all activities of the Party. (By late December, the Soviet 
          Union had ceased to exist.) The mostly Russian cast was enormously affected 
          by these events (the coup having taken place during rehearsals) and 
          brought an emotional charge to their performances.<br>
          <br>
          The conjoining of the forces of the Kirov and SFO marked the first time 
          such cooperation had taken place between a Russian and an American company. 
          Conceived by Lotfi Mansouri and brought into being by Sarah Billinghurst, 
          it not only featured the American debut of Valery Gergiev and several 
          other artists (Ognovenko, Zaremba) who have gone on to revolutionize 
          the opera world, it brought this masterpiece to the forefront and began 
          an unprecedented era in the rediscovery of Russian opera all over the 
          world. Our company has greatly benefited as well, with many other artists 
          from the Kirov (Netrebko, Larin, etc.) taking our fair city by storm 
          in productions and co-productions since then.<br>

        <p align="left" class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><a href="funstuff/Vault/chaussers.html"><img src="funstuff/Vault/Andrew/warandpeace.jpg" width="186" height="123" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="left"></a><em>War 
          and Peace</em> was epic in every respect. Even the costumes&#8212;many 
          borrowed from the 1956 Audrey Hepburn / Henry Fonda film of the novel&#8212;were 
          richly splendid. Four hours of music with thirteen separate tableaux, 
          including invading armies, the burning of Moscow, Napoleon and his horse, 
          and a chorus sung by the entire population of Russia (or so it seemed) 
          challenged the company&#8217;s resources and ingenuity to the breaking-point. 
          One hundred and sixty Supers (at least&#8212;reports vary) were on hand 
          to portray French Hussars, G&eacute;rard and Jacquot soldiers and officers; 
          and Russian Kutuzov officers, Ismailov guards, Cossacks, grenadiers, 
          chasseurs, gypsies, prisoners, and casualties.</p>
        <p align="left" class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;">The 
          rehearsals took place in five languages. Occasionally, this made for 
          great amusement. Once Russian soldiers were carrying sandbags to build 
          a barricade and Parisian director J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Savary proclaimed, 
          &#8220;No, they must look like <em>kilos</em> not <em>pillows</em>.&#8221; 
          (In his inimitable accent, they rhymed.) Another time we were rehearsing 
          the scene in which the French soldiers (chorus and Supers) pour into 
          Moscow. Monsieur Savary observed the first pass at the scene and then 
          spoke into the house mike, &#8220;When you go on stage, you <em>must</em> 
          show a penis.&#8221; Dead silence, quizzical looks, followed by raucous 
          laughter from the entire cast. After a frantic consultation with an 
          aide, he once again took up the mike: &quot; &#8216;<em>appiness</em>! 
          You must show &#8216;appiness!&#8221;</p>
        <p align="left" class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;">Supers 
          were, for the first time in SFO history, pretty much forbidden to be 
          in the house except when on stage. We were dressed in Zellerbach Hall 
          and then paraded to the house up Franklin Street, often to the consternation 
          of motorists and passers-by who believed San Francisco was being invaded. 
          This parade made both <a href="funstuff/WPHC.htm">Herb Caen </a>and 
          Channel 2 News.</p>

        <p align="left" class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Many 
          of today&#8217;s Supers came to SFO having debuted in <em>War and Peace</em>. 
          It was a monumental production in every sense, and today, thirteen years 
          later, we pay it tribute.</font></p>
