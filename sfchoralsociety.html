      <h4 align="left" style="margin-top: 0;"><font size="2">Elaine

      <p>I have not been that active supering but hope to be back at it this fall in <em>Idomeneo</em>. I believe it is the production I was in a few years ago. I have been busy singing as you can see &amp; want to share our work with you.<br>
          <br>
      On Saturday, April 5, at 8 p.m., and Sunday, April 6, at 7:30 p.m., the 150 voice San Francisco Choral Society will present Welsh composer Karl Jenkins' <em>The Armed Man - A Mass For Peace</em>, written for the millennium. This is the second concert in our &quot;Season for Peace&quot; series.  Americans have not heard of Karl Jenkins but he is at the top of the classical charts in the UK.  The &quot;Armed Man&quot; mass has some incredibly memorable melodies, as well as some of the most beautiful harmonies in any piece we've ever performed.  The piece is a musical journey that calls upon belief and faith in the face of war, with a rich affirmation of humanity in its poetry.  This is one concert you will leave humming! </p>
      <p>If you've never been to a performance by a chorus with this many voices before, you're sure to be thrilled. Recordings and TV broadcasts cannot capture how it feels to be in the audience at a live performance by a large chorus. The sound is a physical force that moves through your body.<br>
          <br>
        The Choral Society will perform this magnificent work at <a href="http://www.stpaulsf.org/" target="_blank">St. Paul's Church</a> in Noe Valley at 221 Valley St at Church. This is near 30th &amp; Church. This English Gothic style church was built between 1897 and 1911 and features a large collection of stained glass windows from Munich and a main altar of Carrara marble from Italy. This intimate church - where Whoopi Goldberg's &quot;Sister Act&quot; was filmed - will be an ideal venue for the concert. Parking will be available.  We will be accompanied by four professional soloists and a boy treble soloist, the California Chamber Symphony &amp; a Muslim cleric who will recite Call to Prayer. </p>
      <p>Tickets are $28 for Front Orchestra (reserved), $25 for Back Orchestra (reserved), and $22 for far back and sides (general admission, but sides are obstructed by columns). Students and Seniors get a $2 discount per ticket in all seating areas. <br>
          <br>
        To purchase tickets in advance, please contact <a href="http://www.cityboxoffice.com">City Box Office</a>  (415-392-4400).<br>
        You can see a seating chart of the church on the City Box Office website. Tickets will also be available at the door.</p>
      <p>This is one of those concerts you simply must not miss, and we hope to see you there!</p>
