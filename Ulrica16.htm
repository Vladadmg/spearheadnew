        taking the summer off Ulrica is back, relaxed and refreshed and with renewed 
        rancor.</font></p>
      <h1 class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">SHAME!</font></h1>

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Word 
        quickly got around that the Supers are not listed in the program for this 
        season's <em>Tosca</em> and an advance copy of the program confirmed that. 
        Maybe it was an accidental oversight and we'll get an insert for the performances 
        (like the Children's Chorus did last season) but really, how hard is it 
        to remember to include these things? And it isn't as though anyone could 
        forget there are Supers in this one. Heads would no doubt roll if a name 
        were omitted from any of the twelve pages of donors. Our commitment is 
        large (50 – 60 hours per show) and our expectations low, but getting our 
        names in the program is one of them and it means a lot to us that we get 
        it. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Super 
        listing aside, someone should do a serious quality check on the SFO programs. 
        The covers have become hideous, the paper stock is shabby, the graphics 
        contrived, the artist-profile photos very dated (and don't include the 
        <em>comprimari </em> who are also members of the chorus). And whatever 
        happened to production photographs? “We're cutting costs” would no doubt 
        be the knee-jerk reply but Ulrica assumes that <em>Phantom of the Opera</em> 
        paid dearly for its full-page color ad. Or how about going back to charging 
        patrons a few bucks per program? That way we might get a staple job that 
        outlasts the performance. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">On 
        the plus side, however<strong>, Kip Cranna</strong>'s illuminating program 
        notes are always a pleasure to read. </font></p>

        Firsts </font></h1>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Congratulations 
        in advance to the beautiful and friendly <em>maestra </em><strong>Sara 
        Jobin </strong> when, at the November 7th performance of <em>Tosca</em>, 
        she will become the first woman to conduct a main-season, main-stage performance 
        at the San Francisco Opera (!!); an occasion not to be missed. But if 
        you do she will also conduct a performance of <em>Der Fliegende Holl&auml;nder 
        </em> on December 1st. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">And 
        can it be true that there are no gay Supers in a <strong>John Copley </strong> 
        production? (Even the dresser is straight!) Hard to believe but it appears 
        to be the case in this season's <em>Traviata. </em> Of course things would 
        have been different had Ulrica not been fired from that opera… </font></p>
      <h1 class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">She 
        W</font><font size="2">ondered Aloud… </font></h1>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Although 
        Ulrica would never question such things, her evil twin Stregata has been 
        going around making impolite noises about certain SFO policies. “Can anyone 
        explain,” she slurred, “the thing about Supers and rehearsals?” Seems 
        she is confused about who gets to miss rehearsals (and performances) and 
        keeps their part and who doesn't. “And how long are we going to be told 
        we don't fit costumes that we've worn before?” </font></p>
      <p align="center" class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><strong><img src="funstuff/images/Ulrica9_27/rmg03-3.jpg" width="276" height="228"></strong></font></p>
      <p align="center" class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="1">Still 
        Searching for Costumes that Fit</font></p>
      <p align="left" class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">“Stregata, 
        dear,” I purred, “sylphlike as you are, a lot can happen to a body in 
        a few years. Besides I know that those lovely folks in wardrobe are, even 
        at this very late hour, searching for a ‘costume that fits.'” With that, 
        Stregata threw me a curse and went back to finishing her foaming Venomous 
        Toad and Wolf's Bane cocktail. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Over 
        a delicious dim sum lunch with recent Spearhead interviewee <strong><a href="Interviews/Laurel.htm">Laurel 
        Winzler</a></strong>, Ulrica got the lowdown on a few things, both local 
        and further afield. First off was a clipping from <em>The St. Petersburg 
        Times </em> showing details of a proposed addition to the Mariinsky Theatre 
        in the former Leningrad. What at first appeared to be a small-scale <strong>IM 
        Pei </strong> add-on, turned out to be, on closer inspection, a gigantic 
        malignant growth attached to the rear of the pretty theater. Grounds for 
        another Cold War? We think so…</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"><img src="funstuff/images/Ulrica9_27/mariinsky.jpg" width="273" height="195"></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Then 
        La Winzler brought up a very salient point regarding parking for Supers. 
        Seems the administration has contracted with a new, rather aggressive 
        lot of parkers and they are charging <em>everyone </em>to use it (a <em>very</em> 
        famous soprano apparently gets hit for $2 per show). Union rules apparently 
        make the chances of even <em>paid</em> parking privileges for Supers little 
        or none, but does the House relish the idea of us risking life and limb 
        to park for late calls on dodgy Gough Street? Even Ulrica's broomstick 
        has been broken into right there, just two blocks from the stage door. 
        </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><strong>Ex-employee 
        Sightings</strong></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Many 
        ex-employees of SFO are much missed and one is usually very happy to see 
        them. Such was the case when Ulrica bumped into two once-prominent backstage 
        ladies (one famous for very frizzy hair and ursine temperament, the other 
        for directing the infamous “Triumphal Milling Around” during the 2001 
        <em>Aida</em>) on Franklin Street during the summer season. A cheerful 
        “how are things going in New York?” was met with silence and supercilious 
        glares and Ulrica was left with the feeling that a better question would 
        have been “Things not working out on the East Coast, girls?” </font></p>

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">All 
        had a good time at <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/09/13/BAGPI8O2UQ1.DTL" target="_blank">Opera 
        in the Park</a>, but wasn't <strong>Ren&eacute;e Fleming </strong> supposed 
        to be there? She wasn't much missed by this correspondent, who chose to 
        see <strong>Prince </strong> perform in San Jose the night of the poorly 
        named &quot;Viva La Diva&quot; gala. After reports of an underwhelming 
        &quot;Casta Diva&quot;<em> </em>during the first half, we think that was 
        probably a wise choice. Renee seems determined to be the new <strong>Cheryl 
        Studer </strong> and forego her natural talent for Mozart and Strauss 
        to misguidedly sing everything, including the <em>bel canto </em> repertoire; 
        this despite the reception she got for her La Scala <em>Lucrezia Borgia</em>s 
        a few seasons back and an overdecorated vanity production of <em>Il Pirata 
        </em> at the Met last year. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">However, 
        the real <em>bel canto </em> thing, trouper and all-time record holder 
        for OITP attendance, beloved soprano <strong>Ruth Ann Swenson</strong>, 
        <em>was </em>there and gamely sang the aria from <em>Adriana Lecouvreur 
        </em>– twice! – when the noise from a lost helicopter drowned out her 
        pianissimo first time around. Brava! </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Seems 
        that General Director <strong>Pamela Rosenberg </strong> lightens up in 
        adversity. During the circling helicopter &quot;crisis&quot; she was funnier 
        than we've ever heard her and really rose to the occasion; having the 
        on-site photographer look through his telephoto lens to identify the helicopter, 
        contacting the FAA and the SFPD and discovering that the hapless South 
        Bay pilot was looking for the Dave Matthews Band<strong> </strong> concert 
        going on elsewhere in GG Park that afternoon. No doubt the sea of &quot;Bravo&quot; 
        signs and the full orchestra failed to register and the mass of &quot;‘Go 
        Away!&quot;-waving arms were seen as signs of welcome and encouragement.

        was also suggested that voters in San Francisco's District Seven vote 
        against one clueless <strong>Dr. Milton “Rennie” O'Brien </strong> who

        Villaz&oacute;n</a></strong> was perhaps encouraged by a margarita or 
        two? I have to say that I think it is a great shame that Pamela won't 
        be renewing her contract: she seems to be settling nicely into the role 
        of the Mrs. Thatcher of San Francisco Opera. Not only that but after a 
        couple more seasons we would have expected to see a few Pamela Rosenberg

        Speaking of Mr. Pollard, another, once overactive Super was at a Hollywood 
        lunch party hosted by the <a href="http://www.masquersclub.org" target="_blank">Masquers 
        Club</a> a few weeks ago and mentioned, in passing, his involvement with 
        SFO. Immediately afterwards a fellow by the name of <strong>Aaron Kinkaide 
        </strong> came up to him and said “I wonder if you know a friend of mine 
        who just moved to Michigan…” Seems that Aaron and Oliver go way back, 
        were once roommates and that Oliver would be passing through LA very soon 
        and meeting up with him. Any news from Oliver?</font></p>

        Spear and the life of an SFO Super. And did anyone see ex-Super Cap'n

        quarters brilliantly re-conceived as a vast, sparsely furnished, fluorescent-lit 
        recreation hall. The intriguing, <em>faux</em>-marble-finished sliding 
        flats suggested an update to the 1980s, and the Seattle grunge costumes 
        on Chorus and Supers would support that. Once again, all color has been 
        bleached from the production lest there be any unwelcome emotional responses 
        to this beautiful opera. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Seems 
        as though the director <strong>Sabine Hartmannshenn </strong> made few 
        friends amongst the Supers with her persistent “Stop! Stop! Stop!” and 
        for uttering the words that no Super should ever have to hear: “Extras 
        to ze back, behind the chorus, in ze dark, please!” Immediately followed 
        by “Vere are ze Supers? I cannot see any Supers…” </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">And 
        isn't it traditional for directors to stick around for Opening Night? 
        Not so for Frau Hartmannshenn, who had flown back to her native K&ouml;ln 
        two days earlier. </font></p>

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Super 
        rehearsals for <em>Tosca</em> started this weekend with what promises 
        to be the funniest cast ever. Scarpia (<strong>Mark Delavan</strong>), 
        the Sacristan (<strong>Mark Close</strong>)<strong>, </strong> and Spoleta 
        (<strong>Tony Laciura</strong>, the&quot;The Clown Prince of Opera&quot;) 
        have been cracking up the Super &quot;agents&quot; at rehearsals. Add 
        that mischievous diva <strong>Carol Vaness </strong> to the mix and anything 
        could happen. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">And 
        thank goodness we still have The Divine <strong>Sandra Bernhard</strong> 
        on board. She will always be a source of good, clear direction, humor, 
        encouragement and patience<em> </em>– no matter how long it takes us to 
        remember our musical cues. </font></p>
