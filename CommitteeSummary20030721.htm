              IN ACTION </font></h1>
            <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp; 
              </font></p>
            <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The 
              Super Committee convened for its monthly meeting on July 21st at 
              6:30 with members of the incoming committee (Andrew Korniej, Mimi 
              Timberlake, Paul Newman, Mike Harvey, Susan Anderson and Priscilla 
              Lore) and members of the outgoing (Tom Carlisle, Larry Severino, 
              Bruce McNaughton and Nancy Huie). Also present were members of the 
              <em>Spearhead </em> editorial team, Mark Burstein and Lynn Meinhardt. 
              New member Sally Warren was out of town. Priscilla volunteered to 
              take over both the secretarial duties (recording the minutes, etc.) 
              and maintaining the Super bulletin board in the basement. </font></p>
            <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp; 
              </font></p>
            <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As 
              is the tradition at the first meeting of the term, champagne was 
              served, donated by Larry and Andrew. </font></p>
            <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp; 
              </font></p>
            <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The 
              most pressing item discussed was the July 31st Super Call. As everyone 
              who attended it knows Mimi did an incredible job of organizing and 
              getting the food and drinks. Susan donated the Peet's coffee and 
              all the committee members who were able to do so that night volunteered 
              in some capacity; including check in, photography and helping the 
              various departments to take notes. </font></p>
            <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp; 
              </font></p>
            <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Another 
              important agenda item was a fundraiser for the Opera House, which 
              had been discussed at previous meetings. The Committee is hoping 
              to put together an afternoon Open House at the Opera for friends 
              and family of Supers. Attendance will be by donation, with perhaps 
              a two-tiered price structure, and might include wig and make-up 
              demonstrations, acting classes, photo ops, backstage tours etc. 
              A sub-committee comprised of Susan, Mimi, Paul and Andrew (with 
              Lynn as Special Consultant) was formed to develop the idea and will 
              be meeting soon. We hope to be able to stage the event on a Saturday 
              afternoon during the Fall Season. Further details will be announced.

            <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There 
              was also some discussion of our annual party. We will need to book 
              the venue very soon and, depending on availability, hope to return 
              to Stern Grove, where it has been held for the past two years. Our 
              other option is a return to the Green Room at the Veterans' building. 
              We would love to hear your feedback on the venue, so please contact 
              Andrew at akorniejsupers@yahoo.com if you have any thoughts on this 
              matter. We hope to be able to cater the event again but may need 
              to ask for a small donation to help defray the costs. </font></p>

              also discussed this website and are pleased to say that we have 
              had a very positive response so far. Thanks to all who have taken 
              the time to let us know what they think of the site. Andrew also 
              reported that the Super Achievement Plaque by the bulletin board 
              has been updated so check it out. </font></p>
