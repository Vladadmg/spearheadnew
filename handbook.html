    HISTORY<br>
    You are joining a prestigious opera company with a world-class reputation.
    Founded in 1922 by Gaetano Merola, the Company has been present in the War
    Memorial Opera House since 1932 (except for a brief earthquake retrofit during
    the 1990s). Merola led the Company to international prominence until his death
    in 1953. The Company presented the leading singers of the day, including Kirsten
    Flagstad, Lauritz Melchior, Lawrence Tibbett, Elisabeth Rethberg, Giovanni
    Martinelli, Friedrich Schorr and Lily Pons. Kurt Herbert Adler, who ran the
    Company until 1981, succeeded Merola. During the Adler years, the company introduced
    many celebrated artists to this country, including Renata Tebaldi, Leonie Rysanek,
    and Birgit Nilsson. Since that time, we have had only 3 other directors: Terry
    McEwan (1981-1988), Lotfi Mansouri (1988-2002) and now, Pamela Rosenberg continues
    the legacy. Nearly every great opera singer in the last 80 years has graced
    our stage. <br>
    <br>
    YOU BELONG TO A GREAT TEAM<br>
    Now, as a supernumerary, you will be sharing this same stage as these legends.
    The San Francisco Opera is a company of many talented artists, including
    principal singers, a world-famous chorus, stagehands, dancers, orchestra,
    conductors,
    the stage directors, and the technicians and artists responsible for lighting,
    scenery and costumes. Your enthusiasm and cooperation are an important part
    of this company&#8217;s great spirit. </font></p>
            <p align="left" class="spearhead"><font size="2"><br>
                <a name="arrival"></a>ARRIVE 15 MINUTES EARLY TO REHEARSALS<br>
    Rehearsals begin promptly at the appointed time. You are expected to be ready
    to go on stage at the time the rehearsal is called. Many of our personnel are
    paid on an hourly scale and if you are late, you will put everyone behind schedule
    and cost the company money. Please plan to arrive no later than 15 minutes
    prior to the scheduled rehearsal time. This enables us to check you in, give
    you any new staging notes, pass out your badge, distribute revised schedules
    and the like. It also enables you to find parking, get settled, don any appropriate
    rehearsLKal attire, etc. It is disruptive and discourteous to your colleagues
    to arrive late. <br>
      <br>
    It is mandatory that supers be present for all rehearsals and performances
    for which they are called, unless you have been officially excused. Your absence
    from even one rehearsal may cause production delays as you learn your staging
    and those around you are restaged. In case of illness or emergency, or if you
    are running late, please telephone us as soon as possible. If an emergency
    arises on the day of a rehearsal or performance, You must contact Carrie Murphy
    at (415/551-6281) or phone the Scheduling Department at 415/565-6479 and ask
    them to pass along the message. Please make the call yourself, do not ask someone
    to call on your behalf unless you are unable to place the call.<br>
      <br>
      MAKEUP &amp; WIG CALLS<br>
      Many people depend upon you to make your call time. Do not try to adjust
      your call time to suit your schedule. Makeup and dress calls might be an
      hour or
    more before the start time of the performance or rehearsal. If you are late,
    then you effectively cause a backlog for the makeup and wig artists. The
      result is a rush to get all of the supers, chorus and ballet complete in
      time for
    curtain. It is not only selfish to be late for your call, but will directly
    affect what is seen on stage &#8211; our ultimate product.</font></p>
            <p align="left" class="spearhead"><font size="2"> <br>
                <a href="#top">(top)</a><br>
                <a name="signin"></a>SIGN-IN AS SOON AS YOU ARRIVE<br>
                The sign-in sheet is posted on the Supers&#8217; Call Board in
                the Opera House, or in a prominent place for an out-of-house
                rehearsal. This is our
        only method
      of knowing that you are here. These sheets are also used to tabulate your
                stipend reimbursement. If you do not sign in, we do not know
                that you have made your
      call time. In that case, it is likely that an alternate will be put on
                in your place. Dressing room assignments and other important
                notices will also be posted
      on the callboard. <br>
        <br>
        AT REHEARSALS AND PERFORMANCES:<br>
        Always wait where stage management personnel can easily locate you<br>
        Stay within hearing distance of the stage mangers while the rehearsal is
        in progress<br>
        Respond promptly to your &#8220;places&#8221; call<br>
      Take your assigned prop (if applicable)<br>
      Stay in your entrance or preset position, and do not wander off. <br>
      Assistant Stage Managers (ASMs) are responsible for making sure everyone
      is in the right place and ready to go. If you have a problem and must leave
      the
      stage area after you are already in place, please tell the ASM. <br>
      Do not pick up or disturb props that are not assigned to you, and never remove
      a prop from the stage area. For your safety, clear the backstage area as
      quickly and quietly as possible before a set change or large exit of chorus
      or supers.<br>
      During rehearsals, the stage managers may ask you to sit in the house auditorium.
      Do not use the bridge across the orchestra pit. Please use the door into
      the lobby from the stage left hallway. When you are in the auditorium, sit
      in the
      right side of the house so that we may easily locate you. No food or beverages
      are allowed in the auditorium. No costumes are allowed in the auditorium.
      No one in body makeup is allowed in the auditorium. Please leave your belongings
      in the auditorium or dressing rooms, NOT in the backstage area where they
      may
      be confused with a prop. Please do not bring valuables with you. <br>
        <br>
        <a href="#top">(top)</a><br>
        <br>
        PLEASE BE PATIENT<br>
        We will try to use your time in rehearsal as efficiently as possible, however,
      you may wish to bring along a book, knitting, etc. with you. Waiting is an
      essential part of preparing a production. You will eventually go on, no matter
      how long it seems to take in rehearsal. Once the show moves into performance,
      the waiting time is minimized. <br>
        <br>
        <a name="visitors"></a>NO VISITORS <br>
        It is company policy that visitors, children and pets are not permitted
        at either rehearsals or backstage during performances. Additionally, please
        do
      not come backstage during a performance or rehearsal for an opera in which
      you are not a super. <br>
        <br>
        <a name="passes"></a>DRESS REHEARSAL PASSES<br>
        Generally, each super may invite ONE GUEST to the final dress rehearsal
        of the opera in which they appear (some opera&#8217;s final dress rehearsals
        will be closed). This is a privilege: please do not abuse it by asking
        to invite
      additional people. Do NOT come to a dress rehearsal for an opera in which
        you are not appearing as a super UNLESS you are using a light-walking
        or other
      volunteer credit. It is not fair to those individuals who have earned the
        right to attend these special rehearsals. If you would like to volunteer
        as a light-walker
      or in some other capacity, see Carrie Murphy for details. <br>
        <br>
        PLEASE BE QUIET BACKSTAGE<br>
        When backstage, please talk only if absolutely necessary. The cumulative
        sound of many people whispering or talking makes it very difficult for
        stage management
      to work effectively and is unfair to other performers. KNOW YOUR NEXT CALL<br>
      The schedule you have received is often very tentative and subject to change.
      Before you leave each rehearsal or performance, make sure you know when you
      are next called. Rehearsal schedules and call times are posted on the callboards.
      You may also telephone 415/565-3200 for a recording of the super rehearsal
      schedule for the current week.<br>
      It is YOUR responsibility to know your next call. We will not call you unless
      there has been a change in the schedule subsequent to your most recent rehearsal. <br>
        <br>
        <a href="#top">(top)</a><br>
        <br>
        <a name="casting"></a>CASTING<br>
        The director, or assistant director on behalf of the director, according
        to the director&#8217;s artistic vision, makes all final selections. If you are
      selected for a part, please do not reject it because you think it does not
      suit you. Having been in a role in a previous production of the opera is no
      guarantee that you will be in that role in a new production. In rare circumstances,
      the director may overrule our casting choices. The stage director&#8217;s
      decision is final.<br>
      Alternates (also known as &#8220;covers&#8221;) may be chosen for each
      show. Alternates must fit the appropriate age, size and type to fit properly
      into
      the costumes. Alternates must attend all rehearsals and performances. There
      is no guarantee that an alternate will go onstage in a performance. REIMBURSEMENT <br>
      Supers receive a stipend of $10 per dress call, which includes dress rehearsals
      plus all performances and $5 per staging rehearsal. Stipend checks are disbursed
      at the final performance.<br>
        <br>
        <a name="costumes"></a>COSTUMES<br>
        Costume fittings are made by appointment at the San Francisco Opera Costume
      Shop, 170 Ninth Street, between Mission and Howard Streets. Fittings may
        take anywhere from 15 minutes to one hour. We will arrange an appointment
        time for
      you. It is important to honor your scheduled fitting. Many people are counting
      on you. If you must be late, or reschedule, please telephone as soon as possible.
      Call Carrie Murphy (415) 551-6281 or phone the shop directly at (415) 551-6300
      if you are unable to reach Carrie in person. <br>
      The Wardrobe Department will be in charge of the costume once it comes to
      the opera house. For performances and costumed rehearsals, go directly to
      your
      assigned dressing room as soon as you have signed in. Dressers will be there
      at the appointed call time to help you put on your costume. <br>
      DO NOT PUT ON YOUR COSTUME WITHOUT A DRESSER PRESENT. You will have an assigned
      dressing table space. Look on the mirror for the costume plot with your name
      on it. <br>
      <a href="#top">(top)</a>    <br>
      Please try not to bring things of value with you to the opera house. San
      Francisco Opera cannot be responsible for lost or stolen items. Lockers
      are provided
      for your use in the hallways outside the dressing rooms with a designation &#8220;Supers.&#8217; Do
      not leave items in the lockers overnight. <br>
      Your costume must be worn as assigned. A Wardrobe or Costume Supervisor must
      approve any proposed changes in a costume. No personal jewelry, including
      body piercings, watches or nail polish should be visible while you are in
      costume.
      Glasses must not be worn on stage without the prior approval of the director. <br>
      Everyone must wear suitable undergarments for all fittings, rehearsals and
      performances.<br>
      The costumes you will be wearing are hand crafted and very expensive. While
      in costume, please do not eat, smoke or drink staining beverages, e.g. coffee,
      tea, soda. If you want to eat during a break, please use one of the robes
      provided to cover your costume. Please be aware that your costume might become
      wrinkled
      or soiled if you sit in it while waiting to go on. This will make you look
      bad on stage. Ask the wardrobe staff for tips on how to sit in a costume
      in the least detrimental way. If your costume needs to be repaired, please
      inform
      your dresser before leaving the theater. <br>
      Due to stringent union contract requirements and potential fines, all performers
      should proceed to their dressing room IMMEDIATELY following your final stage
      appearance, and change out of your costume. Do not linger for photos or chitchat.
      There are NO EXCEPTIONS to this rule! Violations will result in the opera
      company receiving substantial overtime penalties, and your dismissal from
      the super
      roster. After removing your costume, hang it in the space designated by the
      Wardrobe Department. In the case of a quick-change, Dressers will assist
      you.<br>
        <br>
        <a href="#top">(top)</a><br>
        <br>
        <a name="wigs"></a>WIGS AND MAKEUP<br>
        These requirements are different for each show. Usually, each super will
        apply his or her own makeup base using a makeup kit assigned to you individually.
      For hygiene reasons, you should not share your base with anyone else. If
        you
      run out, notify the makeup staff, who will supply you with more. Proceed
        to the makeup room as soon as your base is dry. Wait in line until a makeup
        artist
      calls you. The artist will know exactly what the makeup requirements are
        for the show. You will usually apply your makeup prior to dressing, although
        you
      should check with your dresser first. Once the makeup has been applied, do
      not attempt to alter it.<br>
      The Wig and Makeup Department has rather stringent Health &amp; Safety Guidelines.
      They are instructed to sanitize their hands after working on each client. Also,
      they are instructed to notify their foreman immediately should any client appear
      to have health problems. Health problems are defined to include open wounds
      or sores, conjunctivitis, intoxication, lack of personal hygiene (body odor,
      dirty hair, head lice, etc.) Please see Carrie Murphy or Gerd Mairandres (415/565-6454)
      if you have any such problems to discuss how they may be best resolved to everyone&#8217;s
      satisfaction. <br>
      If a wig or facial hair is to be worn with your costume, a notice will be
      taped onto the mirror at your dressing station. If you see such a notice
      with your
      name on it, go to the wig room and ask if your hair needs to be applied before
      or after you are in costume, then proceed accordingly. If you are wearing
      your own hair and/or facial hair, do not cut it without first checking with
      the
      Wig Master, Gerd Mairandres. As soon as you have made your final appearance
      onstage, proceed directly to have your wig or facial hair removed. Never
      attempt to remove your own wig or facial hair without assistance from the
      wig staff.
      INSURANCE <br>
      San Francisco Opera is concerned about your health and safety while volunteering
      your services for activities and events. San Francisco Opera works to provide
      a safe and healthy environment for all employees as well as volunteers. For
      your benefit, <br>
      we provide an insurance policy as a secondary policy to your own Medical
      Plan for accidents and injuries which may be attributed to your service with
      San
      Francisco Opera. This plan may act as a primary plan if you do not have a
      Medical Plan of your own. <br>
      A summary of the plan is included in this packet. <br>
      <br>
      <a href="#top">(top)</a><br>
      <br>
      <a name="emergency"></a>EMERGENCY CONTACT INFORMATION <br>
      You will also find an Emergency Contact Sheet in this packet. This information
      is strictly confidential for use in a medical emergency only. IDENTIFICATION
      BADGES<br>
      Each super will be issued an identification badge. You should be prepared
      to show this badge to the stage door security personnel upon entering the
      opera
      house. Keep this badge with you at all times when you are in the opera house,
      except when in costume.<br>
      Do not come backstage during a performance or rehearsal if you are not in
      that opera. If you lose the badge, you will be charged $10 to replace it. <br>
        <br>
        <a name="photos"></a> PHOTOGRAPHS<br>
        Photographs provide you and your fellow supers with wonderful mementos
        of your experience. However, please observe common sense and the following
        rules:<br>
        </font><font size="2"><br>
              &#8226; <strong>No photographs may be taken in the communal dressing rooms
                      or backstage</strong><br>
              &#8226; <strong>Do not disturb an artist in his or her dressing room to request
                  a photo</strong><br>
              &#8226; Do not interfere with the needs of the artists or dressers
                  to carry out a timely costume change<br>
        &#8226; If you wish to take photos in your costume, please do so prior to your
        final appearance on stage<br>
        <br>
        Once you have made your last exit, immediately proceed to your dressing
        room and remove your costume. We are governed by very strict union guidelines,
        and any delay can result in overtime and/or fines for the company. <br>
        Opening and closing nights are generally NOT good times for photographs.
        The artists are typically anxious and many last-minute preparations are
        underway. On closing nights, the sets and costumes are generally packed
        up and transported
        as soon as the performance is concluded. <br>
        Please do not disturb singers in their dressing rooms. Although not on
        stage, a singer may be vocalizing, studying their role or simply relaxing.
        Do not
        impose on their personal time or space. Also, do not snap photos as a
        singer is rushing on or off stage. Each show will have an appointed representative
        from the Super Committee who will coordinate a time for artist photos.
        This
        schedule will be posted on the callboard.<br>
