        <em>Tom Reed, chorus</em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">One 
        of my all-time favorite stage mishaps occurred in 1979 when San Francisco 
        Opera mounted a production of Thea Musgrave's <em>Mary Queen Of Scots</em> 
        as the Curran Theater as part of its Spring Opera Theater series. Musgrave 
        was conducting the orchestra in the final dress rehearsal before a guest 
        audience.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">In 
        a castle bedchamber on stage Queen Mary and Bothwell were concluding a 
        romantic duet in bed together. The transformation into the outdoor mob 
        scene that followed the bedroom scene was to be accomplished without bringing 
        in the curtain. At the end of the duet the tapestries and bedroom trappings 
        were to be flown out, and the couple were to be wheeled offstage still 
        lying on their bed while the new backdrop was lowered into place. To keep 
        the action alive during the scene transition, a mob of angry townspeople 
        (the chorus) was to run onstage from upstage right, screaming and waving 
        weapons, cross the back of the stage, and exit upstage left. Then, once 
        the transition from bedroom to town square was complete, the chorus mob 
        was to reenter from stage left into the town square where they would stage 
        a revolt against Queen Mary.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"><br>
        But at the dress rehearsal all did not go as planned. As the chorus stood 
        in the wings up right waiting for the cue to run across the back of the 
        set, one of the choristers decided to play a trick on the chorister who 
        was always the first to enter at the front of the mob. Just for fun he 
        sharply nudged the frontrunner and said &quot;Go!&quot; Unexpectedly, 
        not realizing that it was still several pages too early, the hapless chorister 
        ran, screaming and waving a rifle across the back of the palace bedroom. 
        Bothwell lurched upward and Queen Mary nearly twisted her neck trying 
        to see the unexpected invader. The chorister later said he'd realized 
        halfway across the stage that he was way too early, but decided that he 
        might as well continue screaming until he reached the other side of the 
        stage. The duet ended on a rather tentative note as the bewildered couple 
        was wheeled offstage, still looking to see what was going on. Then, on 
        cue, as the set changed, the rest of the chorus mob ran screaming across 
        the stage, looking more like they were searching for the man who'd dared 
        invade the royal bedroom. Meanwhile in the pit, composer/conductor Musgrave 
        was laughing so hard she had to momentarily step away from the podium.</font></p>
