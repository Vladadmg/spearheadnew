      <p align="left"><em>I
            have been bragging about the San Franciso Opera supers to everyone
            I know. The article is great and the pictures are wonderful. Thank
                you and all the supers very much. Please convey my thanks to all
                the Tosca

      <h4 align="left">An Interview with Anthony Laciura<img src="/Interviews/images/laciurapics/laciura1.jpg" width="190" height="206" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right"></h4>
      <p>Knowing that <strong>Anthony Laciura</strong> portrayed 
        the Schoolmaster in this past summer&#8217;s marvelous production of <em>The 
        Cunning Little Vixen</em> is most appropriate because he himself appears 
        to be a teacher of sorts. His aim in life is to follow the principle once 
        passed on to him by his late friend and mentor, <strong>Norman Treigle</strong>, 
        who once told him &#8220;that you must always strive to assist and educate 
        other people, especially the young, so that you can be a mentor to them.&#8221; 
        This is exactly what Norman was to the young Anthony.<br>
        <br>
        Our Spoletta in the recently completed production of <em>Tosca</em> was 
        born, raised, and educated in New Orleans. Anthony did his undergraduate<img src="/Interviews/images/laciurapics/laciura2.jpg" width="300" height="199" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left"> 
        work for a Bachelor&#8217;s Degree in Music Education at Loyola University 
        (where he met his wife, <strong>Joelle</strong>), before graduating from 
        Tulane University with a Master&#8217;s Degree in Fine Arts and Music. 
        He still has a brother and two sisters living in New Orleans, as well 
        as many in-laws. Anthony started singing with the boys' choir of Sacred 
        Heart Church in New Orleans when he was eight years of age. His mother 
        played the clarinet but his father, Anthony admits, couldn&#8217;t carry 
        a tune in a bucket. However he did have a female cousin who sang principal 
        roles with New Orleans Opera. <br>
        <br>
        Anthony began to study singing, privately, at the age of ten. While he 
        was singing in the boys' chorus of the New Orleans Opera production of 
        <em>Tosca</em> he was so excited by the performance of the Scarpia that 
        he decided then and there to become an opera singer. When he was eleven 
        years old he made his debut with the Opera as the newsboy in <em>Louise</em>. 
        <img src="/Interviews/images/laciurapics/agents.jpg" width="400" height="266" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">Norman Treigle sang the role of the Father opposite <strong>Dorothy Kirsten</strong>&#8217;s 
        Mother, and it was then that Norman befriended him. After his stint with 
        the boys' chorus he became a Super; supering from the age of thirteen 
        through seventeen. He was also a gofer for the Opera and later sang in 
        opera workshops at Loyola.<br>
        <br>
        Anthony&#8217;s favorite role is the Simpleton in <em>Boris Godounov</em>. 
        In Mussorgsky&#8217;s original 1869 version (not always adhered to), the 
        Simpleton is the last person on stage at the end of the opera, singing 
        his plaintive melody for his beloved Russia; a very affecting moment. 
        He also enjoyed working with the director <strong>Danny Slater</strong> 
        recently, in Santa Fe, in a production of <em>Wozzeck</em> in which he 
        played the Fool. I hope that isn&#8217;t typecasting. As for the most 
        challenging role he has undertaken so far, that would be Mime in Siegfried, 
        which is also, in his mind, the most rewarding in his repertoire.<br>
        <br>
        Unlike us Supers, he has no least-favorite role, but as for parts he has 
        not, as yet, had the opportunity to essay, one is Vasek in <em>The Bartered
        Bride</em>. Vasek is the stuttering, bashful beau. This would be only too fitting 
        for the one who was dubbed by the Washington Post as the &#8220;Clown 
        Prince of Opera,&#8221; a soubriquet he is most pleased with. I think 
        that the title was richly earned for his outstandingly comic titular performance 
        of Rameau&#8217;s Plat&eacute;e.<br>
        <br>
        <span class="spearhead"><img src="/Interviews/images/laciurapics/laciura3.jpg" width="300" height="184" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right"></span> 
        In response to the question of whether anything disastrous had ever happened 
        to him during a performance, he could not recall a single event. As for 
        his fellow performers, though, he remembers one time when a Turandot edged 
        up to him just before her second act aria and whispered that she was about 
        to be sick. He said &#8220;Oh no, you&#8217;re not!&#8221; and signaled 
        off-stage for a towel to be ready. She made it to the end of the act and 
        the towel was much appreciated at the curtain. Then there was the instance 
        when Anthony, sitting in a boat with Giulietta in <em>Tales of Hoffmann</em>, 
        was just about to be pushed on stage when she turned to him and said &#8220;I&#8217;m 
        not pretty and I can&#8217;t sing!&#8221; He thereupon took her in his 
        arms and told her that she was beautiful and a wonderful singer. He seems 
        to have a way with the ladies.<br>
        <br>
        The on-stage vignette I found most interesting was the time he was performing 
        Goro in <em>Madama Butterfly</em>, when in the first act the tenor singing 
        Pinkerton suddenly froze up and just stood there without a peep coming 
        out. Anthony turned his back to the audience and sang the tenor&#8217;s 
        lines, then he turned to face the audience and sang his own role. During 
        intermission the conductor came backstage and told the tenor that he had 
        sung beautifully, then he turned to Anthony and told him he was behind 
        the beat.<br>
        <br>
        <img src="/Interviews/images/laciurapics/laciura4.jpg" width="250" height="375" hspace="5" align="left">In 
        addition to the seventy-five roles in opera that Anthony has sung throughout 
        his illustrious career, many of which are noted in the biographical sketches 
        in the programs for <em>Tosca</em> and <em>Vixen</em>, he has also appeared 
        in many musicals. Tony was &quot;Tony&quot; in both <em>West Side Story</em> 
        and <em>The Most Happy Fella</em>, as well as having roles in <em>The 
        Student Prince</em> and, as Tevye, in <em>Fiddler on the Roof.</em><br>
        <br>
        As you may have noticed in his bios, Anthony has sung extensively around 
        North America, but he is also fond of his engagements abroad in Japan, 
        Geneva and, especially, Amsterdam where he appeared in a concert performance 
        of <em>Der Rosenkavalier</em> in the Concertgebouw, which, he adds, has 
        great acoustics (although the best are still to be found in Carnegie Hall). 
        The Dutch audience was ecstatic after the performance and demanded bow 
        after bow. So much so that when the cast was later walking down a street, 
        diners would stand and go to the window to applaud. The response by Japanese 
        audiences was even greater.<br>
        <br>
        Anthony&#8217;s next engagement, after San Francisco, will be the Witch 
        in <em>Hansel and Gretel</em> for the Palm Beach Opera Company. As for 
        further down the road, he would like to try his hand at directing and, 
        of course, teaching. He has enjoyed his experiences here in San Francisco. 
        He loves The City and claims that the Supers here are the friendliest, 
        kindest and most talented and interesting group of Supers he has ever 
        worked with, and he is looking forward to a chance to return very soon.<br>
        <br>
        Many of his recordings with the Met are available on CD as well as DVD. 
        Anthony thinks his best performance is in <em>Il Nozze di Figaro</em>, 
        in which he sings Don Basilio.<br>
        <br>
        We all thank Anthony for the generosity of the time he spent with us while 
        here.<br>
