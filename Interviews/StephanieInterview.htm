      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font color="#FF00FF" size="3"><strong>Salter 
        of the Earth</strong></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><img src="images/Salter%20pics/SalterWerther.jpg" width="161" height="236" hspace="0" vspace="0" align="right">Stephanie 
        Salter first got hooked when she was assigned to do a first-person piece 
        about supering for the old <em>Examiner </em> Sunday magazine in 1985 
        and performed in a <em>Werther </em> (right) with Alfredo Kraus. Since 
        then, she's been in about twenty operas and keeps “a huge album with photos, 
        programs, Super souvenirs, notes from others Supers and some of the columns 
        or stories I wrote about specific productions.”</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Even 
        those of us who haven't had the pleasure of supering with her know her 
        from the Whine Awards at the <a href="../Ulrica9.htm" target="_blank">annual 
        party</a>. Originally designated for the Super who complained the most, 
        the criterion was re-thought after she awarded it to herself two years 
        in a row. Now it goes to the Super(s) who had the most reason to <em>kvetch</em> 
        but elected not to—most unusual behavior in our crowd. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Stephanie 
        had a storybook Midwest upbringing in Terre Haute, Indiana—“high school 
        cheerleader (best job I ever had).” After graduating from Purdue University 
        in journalism, she spent a few years in New York working at <em>Sports 
        Illustrated</em>. She came to our fair city for the usual reason: love. 
        “The romance didn't last, but my affection for this city certainly has.” 
        </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">She 
        grew up entranced by the American Musical, of course, and credits her 
        dear friend Blanche Streeter, who is on the Merola board, with patiently 
        educating her in opera, beginning in 1981, and she has held season tickets 
        ever since. She's also become fond enough of supering to perform with 
        both SFB in the <em>Nutcracker </em> and the Kirov when they were here 
        on tour.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Salter's 
        been on staff of the <em>Examiner </em> or <em>Chronicle </em> for twenty-seven 
        years, a columnist for sixteen of them, and now writes two or three pieces 
        a month for the weekly “Sunday Living” section unless she's working on 
        an investigative piece, which she does about once year. You can read some 
        of her <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/search/columnists.cgi?waisdbname=/web/wais-indexes/chronicle/&byline=stephanie+salter" target="_blank">archived 
        columns</a> here.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Stephanie 
        reminisces about some of her on- and off-stage moments:</font></p>

        was your favorite r&ocirc;le? </em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">I 
        think I just had it, as the homeless woman in Act 3 of this year's <em>Boh&egrave;me</em>. 
        I mean, I really got a chance to emote, and<a href="../images/bohemepics/La%20Boheme%201/bohemepics-Pages/Image15.html" target="_blank"> 
        </a>John (“Digital”) Martin was a great <a href="../images/bohemepics/La%20Boheme%201/bohemepics-Pages/Image15.html" target="_blank">Hume 
        Cronyn to my Jessica Tandy</a>. Being part of the ensemble in SFO's first 
        <em>Elektra</em> (with Dame Gwyneth Jones in 1991) was a close second. 
        My first (and maybe only) end-of-opera curtain call. What a rush! &nbsp; 
        </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em>Your 
        least favorite? </em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><img src="images/Salter%20pics/SalterRigoletto.jpg" width="212" height="295" hspace="4" vspace="0" align="left">I've 
        repressed it. They all seem bad about the fourth rehearsal when the director 
        is in major anal-retentive mode, Supers are standing around growing moss 
        and the diminishing sands of time in one's personal hour glass of life 
        seem to be falling at an accelerated pace. I will say that the 1990 Ponnelle 
        <em>Rigoletto</em> (left) was the most painful role ever (it even beat 
        being in the Hockney <em>Magic Flute</em> griffin costume—<a href="../funstuff/Griffin.html" target="_blank">ask 
        Priscilla</a>!): we women Supers had to do the can-can in high-heeled 
        platform shoes that were made of concretized painted leather and— really—wood. 
        &nbsp; </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em>Which 
        one would you say represented you personally?</em> </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"><img src="images/Salter%20pics/SalterArabella.jpg" width="170" height="246" hspace="4" vspace="0" align="right">I 
        think being a maid and then a hotel guest with Andrea Kohlruss in <em>Arabella</em> 
        in 1998 (right). It was so “easy to be me.” Playing a nun during the “Te 
        Deum” of <em>Tosca</em> is never a stretch either, not because I'm nun-like, 
        but because I'm thoroughly electrified by the musical and dramatic tension 
        of that scene—all that lust and love and power grabbing going on in secret 
        in church! It's the human condition. Being a converted Catholic also helps. 
        </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em>What 
        do you like to get cast as? </em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Anything 
        that does not require that I must stay stock still, especially downstage. 
        My one stint as a handmaiden during the Hockney <em>Turandot</em> (Gabrielle 
        Schnaut and Audrey Stottler) was a constant struggle to keep an anxiety 
        attack at bay. I like to move onstage; it helps release the extra energy. 
        &nbsp; </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em>What 
        have been some of your favorite onstage moments? </em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><img src="images/Salter%20pics/SalterTosca.jpg" width="171" height="256" hspace="4" vspace="0" align="left">Greeting 
        guests with Andrea in <em>Arabella</em>; soliciting johns with Rene deJarnatt 
        in the 1988 <em>Boh&egrave;me</em> (Pavarotti and Freni two feet away? 
        Who cared if they were “too old” for the parts?); my first <em>Tosca</em> 
        (left) in 1992 (I fell in love with one of Scarpia's henchmen; it ended 
        badly but, boy, what memories I have!); swirling around as a fairy dancer 
        thing in <em>Rusalka</em>; sitting at the Momus in 2000 with Tom Carlisle 
        and Susan Mead; and getting abused and kicked around in this year's <em>Boh&egrave;me</em>, 
        especially by Mark Huelsmann. Anxiety ridden as I was during <em>Turandot</em>, 
        I was frequently moved to tears by the power of being that close to “In 
        questa regia”—yes, even when Schnaut sang it.&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em>Have 
        you had any unusual or funny experiences onstage? </em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Oh, 
        my. I'll pick two of the many. In <em>Elektra</em>, I was rear-ended by 
        another Super during the scene in which we beat-up slaves circle Orestes 
        in gratitude and awe. I was accustomed to look up to see an ordinary looking 
        guy (Monte Pederson) but, one night, there was Tom Fox who, in a long 
        black wig, looked like the ultimate hunk a hunk o' burnin' love. He was 
        gorgeous, and I just stopped in my tracks and stared—and got run over.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"><img src="images/Salter%20pics/SalterWar&Peace.jpg" width="243" height="357" hspace="4" vspace="0" align="right">In 
        <em>War and Peace</em>, one of my roles was as a gypsy girl (in a <em>fabulous</em> 
        costume - I'm the middle one in the photo) at the drunken party of some 
        of the military officers. First I had to pretend I was a pony, prancing 
        on my knees while the bass-baritone snapped a whip over my derri&egrave;re—someone 
        in rehearsal told me “You have set women's liberation back 100 years”— 
        then I had (got?) to lie on the floor while Philip Skinner ran his hand 
        up and down my hip and bare leg. Nothing untoward happened, but it felt 
        really good. (Sorry, Mrs. Skinner.) &nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em>What 
        was your biggest challenge? </em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Keeping 
        my bare feet on the stage in Stern Grove during an<em> Italian Girl </em>(in 
        the late ‘80s) that was performed in 90-degree weather and blazing sun. 
        Only after I got out there with no shoes did I realize that the stage 
        surface was blisteringly hot. I was a harem girl but I probably looked 
        like I had St. Vitus' dance. Hopping about on all fours in the Hockney 
        <em>Flute</em> (I did two productions) was a close second. It hurts me 
        to even think about doing that now. My knees are too old. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em>Where 
        were you most visible? Least? </em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Most: 
        this last <em>Boh&egrave;me</em> as the homeless woman—or so all my friends 
        tell me. Least: probably as one of the women-in-black in <em>Pelleas and 
        Melisande</em>. We wore long black dresses, long black veils and we did 
        nothing but kneel behind a long black scrim. As I wrote at the time, the 
        49ers defensive line could have done those parts and no one would have 
        known the difference. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em>What 
        were your favorite and least favorite costumes?</em> </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Many 
        favorites: the blue Dupioni silk nuns' habits in the '92 <em>Tosca</em> 
        (above); the aforementioned gypsy dress in <em>War and Peace</em>; the 
        fairy get-up in <em>Rusalka</em>; all of my Momus party dresses in all 
        <em>Boh&egrave;mes</em> (I saw the '88 version on a chorus woman at the 
        Met two years later!), especially the current one with the red wig and 
        iridescent blue skirt. Least: it's a toss-up between the Ponnelle <em>Rigoletto</em> 
        (those cruel shoes and gowns and robes that weighed as much as the main 
        curtain at the Opera House) and the lethal mirrored headdresses in <em>Die 
        Frau ohne Schatten</em> back in ‘89.&nbsp;<em> </em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em>And 
        now, the big one: why do you do this? </em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">For 
        myriad reasons, but mostly because of two: to <em>inhabit</em> the music 
        as one can only do when one is in a production, and to temporarily leave 
        behind journalism, modern life, mortality, traffic, lying politicians 
        and a national culture that worships “reality” television for whatever 
        century and country and era that's onstage at the Opera House. OK, there's 
        a third: the camaraderie of being a Super. There is no group of folks 
        quite like us. I will Super until they padlock the stage door to keep 
        me out.<em> </em></font></p>
