        INTERVIEW WITH KATHERINE BRAZAITIS</strong><br>
        (From <em>The Spearhead</em> Summer 1997)<br>
        <br>
      I remember Katherine very well from the 1965 production of <em>Werther</em>,
      when I had to stand near the top of an eight foot high ladder, behind a
      scrim
      pretending to be giving a sermon in church. There, directly in front of
      me in the wings was Katherine leading a chorus of other Supers and having
      a great old time mimicking all of my gestures and making faces. Katherine
      became a Super when she and <strong>Susan Anderson</strong> were taking
      ballet class with
      <strong>Marika Sakellariou</strong> at the College of Marin. Marika who
      was the Opera&#8217;s
      Ballet Mistress at the time, suggested that they should contact the Super
      Department (<strong>Karl Ratzner</strong>) and Katherine was immediately cast in the 1981
      Ponnelle production of <em>Rigoletto</em>; in the first act orgy scene with the
      men&#8217;s chorus. It has been a party ever since. Katherine has not kept
      an account of all the operas she has been in since then, but believes it
      has averaged almost two a year.<br>
      <br>
      Her most interesting role to date was the 1983 <strong>Das Rheingold</strong>,
      where she was the only Super cast with ballet dancers, as the non-singing
      Rhine Maidens.
      They had to lie prone on the floor in the heavy fog produced by the stage
      dry ice. The smoke was so overpowering that before they could &#8216;pop
      up&#8217; and do their number, they had to take oxygen from little red
      tanks taped to the back of the rocks. It was also in Das Rheingold that
      she first talked to her husband, Joseph, into his first and only appearance
      as a San Francisco Opera Super, as one of the giants. While carrying his
      load of gold down the steps to the understage, he fell in the dark and
      broke his arm. He lay there for some while before someone came and helped
      him to the dressing room. When Katherine arrived, she found them removing
      the costume and Jenny Green hovering around admonishing &#8220;cut on the
      seams.&#8221;<br>
      <br>
      Returning to the <em>Werther</em> performances, she also remembers standing in the
      wings chatting with other Supers when <strong>Renata Scotto</strong> would pass by reeking
      of so much garlic it would nearly knock you out. She was on her way to
      the stage to do an &#8220;up close and personal&#8221; duet with <strong>Alfredo
      Kraus</strong>. Poor Mr. Kraus.<br>
      <br>
      The next most interesting role was perhaps the <em>Elektra</em> of 1991 with the
      wonderful <strong>Gwyneth Jones</strong>, where she was one of the slave women and Rex and
      the make-up department spent hours covering her in her gunnysack costume
      with eight different kinds of mud. And with blackened teeth, too! Her reward
      was being one of the first out for bows, and though not actually supposed
      to bow, they did one night, and got a round of applause.<br>
      <br>
      All this from the young lady who grew up and went to school in Oklahoma,
      majoring in theater arts before moving to the Bay Area in 1975, where she
      met and married her husband in 1979. She loves to super because of her
      background in the theater and dance, and to be blunt about it, she&#8217;s
      just a ham! But there is also an important aspect to supering, and that
      is the friendships developed over the years. And sometimes it is hard for
      she misses all of the Supers who are no longer with us. Particularly missed
      is <strong>Elayne Ashman</strong>, for whom she subbed in <em>Andrea Chenier</em>.<br>
      <br>
      Katherine is active with the First Methodist Church of San Rafael and has
      worked for Delta Airlines as a ticket agent for the past 25 years. Her
      very first opera was an <em>Aida</em> in the Baths of Caracalla in Rome, where she
      was truly impressed with the venue, the voices and the spectacle from the&#8217;500th&#8217; row
      back. She is still waiting to be in her first production with elephants.
      But pachyderms aside, perhaps appearing with <strong>Leontyne Price</strong> in her last
      Aida in 1984 will have to suffice.<br>
      <br>
      This past season at the Civic Auditorium, Katherine had two roles which
      involved dancing. That&#8217;s why I like to call her the &#8220;Sylph
      of the Civic.&#8221; First came <em>Lohengrin</em> as part of the Bridal Procession
      (and other scenes). She says she really got into the emotions of the piece,
      and in one scene she was to stand in front of <strong>Karita Mattila</strong> as Elsa and
      to protect her from Ortrud. She was so into it, when she looked behind,
      Elsa had moved six to eight feet away.<br>
      <br>
      Next came the <strong>Salome</strong> production, where almost blinded by heavy black veils,
      she had to perform intricate movements with three other dancing Supers,
      all the while making sure not to step on <strong>Karen Huffstodt</strong>&#8217;s costume.
      Lest it become the &#8216;Dance of the Six Veils.&#8217; Both Karita and
      Karen were wonderful to work with, but Karen was a bit more friendly.<br>
      <br>
      As you might have guessed by now, Katherine loves to dance, and she also
      supers with the San Francisco Ballet, having done two <em>Nutcrackers</em> and also
      with the visiting Kirov Ballet in <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> and <em>The
      Sleeping Beauty</em>.
      Ballet rehearsals are much more exciting than most opera rehearsals. In
      opera you walk on, stand and walk off, for what seems a hundred times,
      while in the ballet you get about 20 minutes of some rather complicated
      movements, sometimes in Russian, and then you&#8217;re on!<br>
      <br>
      Katherine thinks she is fortunate that she is tall for she thinks this
      is helpful in getting roles when the director wants to make the soprano
      look smaller than she is (and we all know sopranos!) Every year Katherine&#8217;s
      mother asks her if she is playing nuns or whores that season. So far it&#8217;s
      been seven whores to one nun. She doesn&#8217;t mind, saying that even
      though the pay is the same, whores have much nicer costumes. Which brings
      us to another one of her favorite backstage stories, when in <em>Les Dialogues
      des Carmelites,</em> <strong>Regine Crespin</strong> was carried offstage in a heavy bed, they
      had to use male Supers as nuns. Backstage Mme. Crespin would go around
      looking under the wimple asking &#8220;are you my boy nun or my girl nun?&#8221;<br>
      <br>
      Another story comes from <em>Rigoletto</em> where she had to wear a rubber
      nose, a very tall wig-hat combination glued to her forehead and about 40
      pounds
      of costume, which cut her shoulders. She was sitting down backstage when
      <strong>Maestro Adler</strong> came by and said &#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t be sitting in
      your costume.&#8221; Katherine replied, &#8220;but it&#8217;s so hot and
      this is so heavy.&#8221; All the while <strong>Renee De Jarnatt</strong> and <strong>Carolyn
      Waugh</strong>,
      cowering beside her, were saying, &#8220;You don&#8217;t talk back to Mr.
      Adler!&#8221;<br>
      <br>
      In the upcoming (1997) season she would like to be in the <em>Rigoletto</em> (with
      new costumes we hope) with <strong>Ruth Ann Swenson</strong> and in <em>Tosca</em> with <strong>Carol
      Vaness</strong>      (going shoulder to shoulder?), two singers she admires very much. A few
      of the perks of being a Super she says are being able to listen to <strong>Placido
      Domingo</strong> in <em>Herodiade</em> (she was a harem woman with top on), watching the
      Merola people blossoming into stars, being in <em>The Death of Klinghoffer</em>      and working with <strong>Mark
      Morris</strong>, and not only meeting and getting to know
      other Supers but also all of the wonderful people in the wigs and makeup
      departments, the dressers, and recently, the members of the chorus.<br>
      <br>
      And finally, she would like to know why is it that her husband, who attends
      most of her performances, always has trouble trying to figure out which
      one she is on stage.<br>
