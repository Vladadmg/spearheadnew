      <p><font size="2"><strong>Tim Santry, Makeup Artist<br>
      </strong><font size="1">by Mike Harvey</font><strong>        </strong></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><img src="images/santrypics/Timmacabre.jpg" width="250" height="376" hspace="3" vspace="0" align="right">The 
        first makeup-and-dress call routine is familiar to every Super: Sign in, 
        put on a tattered pink T-shirt (men), apply base with a damp sponge, then 
        trudge down to the makeup room to see what delights are in store. If you're 
        lucky, you'll sit in Tim Santry's chair by the door -- because at the 
        very minimum you'll get expert eye treatment and a little cheekbone enhancement, 
        along with his friendly greeting and maybe even a joke or two. If you're 
        lucky and, depending on the needs of the production, you'll get the full 
        character treatment and be transformed for a few hours into someone else's 
        vision of who you are. In any case, Tim will put you at ease and will 
        quickly begin the almost magical process of turning you into a soldier, 
        nun, lackey, priest, or serving wench. After all, TIm Santry is an artist 
        -- a makeup artist.<br>
        <br>
        Tim is a fifth-generation Californian, who successfully managed 480 acres 
        of corn and wheat as a young man. His ambition at that time was &quot;to 
        be somewhere else,&quot; but to somehow be as good a person as his great 
        grandfather, <strong>Melvin Santry, </strong>an early Californian who 
        was very highly respected and sure of himself. Leaving behind the life 
        of a rancher, and after a stint at Porterville Junior College, Tim transfered 
        to the Theater Arts Department at San Francisco State, where he found 
        himself in SF Opera makeup artist <strong>Bill Jones'</strong> &quot;Advanced 
        Theater Makeup&quot; course. After observing Tim's work during the course, 
        Bill said, &quot;I don't know what you want to do, but you should be doing 
        this for a living.&quot; Tim decided to become a professional makeup artist.<br>
        <br>
        His first experience with San Francisco Opera was an audition for makeup 
        artist for the 1991 mega-production of <em>War and Peace</em>. The audition 
        was extremely thorough and involved a detailed look at Tim's makeup tools 
        and his ability to create makeups for a principal singer, an ethnic look 
        (<em>Turandot</em>), and an old-age makeup. He passed, and joined the 
        SF Opera team.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">It was necessary 
        to work 30 calls in that first year to earn his stripes as an Associate 
        Makeup Artist. The next step was to pass the Journeyman's Exam in order 
        to become a Regional Journeyman Makeup Artist. Further experience led 
        to the levels of Principal Makeup Artist, and Foreman. Tim has since worked 
        countless theater and opera productions as well as industrial shows and 
        films.<br>
        <img src="images/santrypics/DOprogression.jpg" width="600" height="299" vspace="3"><br>
        </font><font size="2">Tim explained that the &quot;look&quot; of any production 
        involves a lot more than slapping on a little base and some eyeliner. 
        It's a collaboration between the production Costume and Lighting Designers 
        and Wig-and-Makeup Designer <strong>Gerd Mairandres</strong> to produce 
        a look that advances and enhances the vision for the production. That's 
        why you'll see Gerd and Tim and others from Wigs and Makeup in the house 
        during dress rehearsals. They're evaluating every tiny detail of their 
        work, and will soon be backstage adjusting and tweaking makeup design 
        until just the right effect has been achieved.<br>
        <br>
        <img src="images/santrypics/blume3.jpg" width="250" height="376" align="right">There 
        is a lot of pressure to get things just right and there's always that 
        lingering dread that something might go wrong in a complex production. 
        Tim says the biggest fear is that an adhesive might fail and something 
        crucial -- like a nose -- will fall off onstage. So you have to be constantly 
        ready to make repairs. Another occasional problem can be shaky hands caused 
        by too much coffee and too little food. During one embarrasing moment 
        before a performance of <em>Arshak</em> a few years ago, Tim's hands were 
        shaking so much that <strong>Ren&eacute; Pape</strong> started laughing 
        and Tim jokingly offered the brush to Ren&eacute; to complete the job.<br>
        <br>
        Tim has a lot of fun with this job. He says that he tends to laugh a lot, 
        and if he can put a performer at ease during the long process of applying 
        a complex and uncomfortable makeup and make them laugh, he knows he's 
        doing his job. The way that he deals with performers can set the mood 
        for an entire show, and he knows the importance of being able to relate 
        effectively to people on both a personal and professional level.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Tim is nowhere 
        near retirement but he already has plans to do some traveling. One of 
        his great interests is archeology, and he hopes one day to spend some 
        time in Egypt and Greece studying those two ancient cultures. For the 
        present however, Tim's ambition is to keep doing the work that he loves.<br>
        <br>
        Although Tim is seemingly reluctant to take himself too seriously, he
        believes that for the makeup artist, the face is a blank canvas
        waiting to be painted - and sometimes he wishes he could sign some of
        his paintings.</font><br>
