        <img src="/Interviews/images/milkopics/milkointerview.jpg" width="250" height="188" align="left">A 
        few weeks ago, I met everyone&#8217;s favorite Super, <strong>Milko Encinas</strong>, 
        for lunch and to talk about his life and career on the operatic stage.<br>
        <br>
        Anyone who has supered alongside the ebullient Milko will remember his 
        infectious love of the experience and will surely have been the happy 
        recipient of his hugs, kisses and &quot;toi toi toi&quot;s. He bounced 
        into the restaurant aglow and not looking a day older than when I first 
        met him, fourteen years ago. I tell him so. &#8220;Moisturizing &#8211; 
        inside and out&#8221; he says, dismissively.<br>
        <br>
        Milko was born in the Philippines and moved to the U.S. at the age of 
        21. For many years he worked for Nordstrom and has been a successful <a href="http://www.milkohomes.com" target="_blank">realtor</a> 
        for the past two years. He still sees the U.S. as a land of opportunities 
        and endless possibilities and he says that his ultimate goal is to be 
        able to take care of his family: his parents in the Philippines, his sisters, 
        nephews and nieces. He is doing what he can to succeed in real estate 
        to achieve that goal.<br>
        <br>
        He comes from an artistic background, studied drama in school, and has 
        a mother who sings and plays the piano. He practices Yoga and has the 
        physical grace and poise of a dancer. He loves to travel (&#8220;it opens 
        the mind&#8221;) and has been going back to the Philippines and other 
        parts of Asia, regularly, and will be visiting Europe this year. Sadly, 
        his marriage to <a href="/WhatsNew/Ulrica12.htm" target="_blank">Christopher</a> 
        did not outlast the year but he is enjoying the single life and working 
        hard.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Two Dames Inspire</strong><br>
        <br>
        It always intrigues me how people come to opera, and to being a Super. 
        For me, that moment came as a student when I was inspired to color my 
        At History thesis with excessively florid prose as I sat in my little 
        garret with a BBC radio broadcast of <em>Tristan and Isolde</em> swelling 
        in the background (I had first heard the &quot;Prelude&quot; and &quot;Liebestod&quot; 
        on the soundtrack of the <strong>Salvador Dali</strong>/<strong>Luis Bunuel</strong> 
        Surrealist masterpiece <em>Un Chien Andalou</em>). For Milko, The Great 
        Moment came 15 years ago as he was driving with his partner to Yosemite 
        National Park on their way to Hetch Hetchy. The only radio reception they 
        could find was a classical station and, as they entered the Park, <strong>Joan 
        Sutherland</strong> was singing &quot;Sempre Libera.&quot; <br>
        <br>
        &quot;It was tantalizing,&#8221; he says, &#8220;I was captivated and 
        hypnotized by the music and the grandeur of nature. From then on I started 
        listening to a little and thought &#8216;I could get into this&#8217; 
        and for Christmas that year I got the CD of <em>Traviata</em>.&quot; Then 
        I started bringing opera into work. I was listening to <strong>Jessye 
        Norman</strong> singing Carmen when a co-worker <strong>Tracy Tornquist</strong> 
        overheard it and asked me if I liked opera (Tracy sang in the Opera Chorus). 
        I told her I was learning about it and she explained what a Super is and 
        gave me (Super Captain) <strong>Harrison Pierce</strong>&#8217;s number. 
        I thought &#8216;This might be fun to do&#8217; and I gave him a call.<img src="/Interviews/images/milkopics/milkoportrait.jpg" width="200" height="333" align="right"><br>
        <br>
        &#8220;Harrison asked me a few questions about my background and then, 
        a week later, called again and asked me to come to the ballet studio for 
        <em>Elektra</em>. That was in 1991. I thought 'How easy!&#8217; and went 
        along thinking I already had a part. Once I was there, however, I realized 
        that it was actually an audition. My heart was pounding and I thought 
        that I should just leave. But the director broke us up into groups of 
        seven and I was in the first group so I couldn&#8217;t leave. Then he 
        told us to act like our favorite animal. I love cats and dogs but I saw 
        that everyone else acting like cats and dogs all over the floor. So I 
        just stood there, raised my arms and began slowly flapping them as though 
        I was a bird. It was the longest two minutes in my life!&#8221; <br>
        <br>
        Of course that scene-stealing movement got him the part and although he 
        has been in many other productions (it happened that his first role was 
        in Bellini&#8217;s <em>I Capuletti</em>, which preceded the Strauss that 
        season) <em>Elektra</em> remains, to this day, his most memorable.</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
        &#8220;It was the most engaging production, our curtain call and <strong>Gwyneth 
        Jones</strong> was riveting, mesmerizing, especially in her opening '<a href="/Interviews/images/milkopics/gallery/longallein.mp3" target="_blank">Allein, 
        allein</a>.'&quot; In fact he was able to pull off a very impressive impersonation 
        of Dame Gwyneth&#8217;s rhythmic march towards the statue of her dead 
        father, Agamemnon, by final dress. &#8220;I get some of their energy and 
        I hope they get some of my enthusiasm.&#8221;<br>
        <br>
        Milko&#8217;s Super career has gone through periods where he has had some 
        of the most prominent Super roles ever, followed by stretches where other 
        activities and interests have drawn him away from the War Memorial stage. 
        Apart from the auspicious role in <em>Elektra</em>, he was one of the 
        original monkey servants to Ping, Pang and Pong in the 1993 televised 
        production of the <strong>David Hockney</strong> <em>Turandot</em> and 
        was practically naked, but for a blue sequined G-string and a pair of 
        cowboy boots (&#8220;Anything for Art&#8221;), in 1996&#8217;s <em>Harvey 
        Milk</em>. But it was his star turn as an exotic eunuch in <em>Giulio 
        Cesare</em> that captivated audiences and earned him a mention in <em>Opera 
        News</em> and a coveted Hammy Award.<br>
        <br>
        &#8220;I get excited&#8221;, he says &#8220;as I get to know the music, 
        but I get even more excited when I get to know the artists; how could 
        you not love (<em>Cesare</em> stars) <strong>David Daniels</strong>, <strong>Ruth 
        Ann Swenson</strong> and <strong>Bejun Mehta</strong>? Getting to know 
        these people, and what their energy is, gives me an elevated experience; 
        interaction in an artistic medium catapults me to a different level every 
        time and triggers my own creativity. I try to be enthusiastic about every 
        role I do, no matter how different, and I hope that comes across.&#8221;<br>
        <br>
        Milko approaches life in general with that enthusiasm, believes that we 
        are all performers in our lives and should give it our best, all of the 
        time. For him, being in an opera is not only fascinating and exciting 
        but prompts him to give of his best. &#8220;I think about being onstage 
        all the time and the excitement of the moment you go onstage,&#8221; he 
        says. &#8220;You can have that feeling, that nervousness, in life. It 
        starts from within.<br>
        <br>
        &#8220;The singers care for and excel in their form and that inspires 
        you to excel in what you do, even if it&#8217;s being a Super. It&#8217;s 
        a team effort and the one common denominator is that we each have to do 
        our best, each and every moment on stage. If Supering can remind you to 
        do that in your life&#8211;go for it.&#8221;<br>
        <br>
        Milko&#8217;s work in Real Estate has kept him too busy to appear in an 
        opera since 2002&#8217;s <em>Cesare</em>, but will be treading the boards 
        again this summer in the company debut of <strong>Bizet</strong>&#8217;s 
        <em>Pearl Fishers</em>. In the meantime, enjoy a selection of photos of 
        some of Milko's most memorable onstage characters in this <a href="/Interviews/images/milkopics/gallery/index.htm"><strong>gallery</strong></a>.</p>
