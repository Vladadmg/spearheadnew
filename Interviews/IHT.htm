        subject of Harry Rolnick's occasional column &quot;Ear for Opera&quot; 
        in the Paris-based newspaper <em>International Herald Tribune</em> on 
        Wednesday, March 7, was Supers.</p>
      <hr>
      <h5 class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Supernumeraries 
        | Sharing the Stage</font></h5>
      <h5 class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wanted: 
        Extras with Patience</font></h5>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Dressed as an 
        apple tree, trying to hoist a naked lady off a cart with one arm, the 
        other lamely grasping her legs so she won't fall into the orchestra pit 
        before a shouting chorus and a gasping audience in the San Francisco Opera 
        House may not be the most dignified way of making a living. But for the 
        ancient society of supernumeraries — an 18th-century term for “extras,” 
        from the Latin “extra numbers” — these antics are part of a night's work. 
        </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">A 
        super, extra — or more popularly, ‘‘spear-carrier” — may be a professional 
        actor or, more likely, a student or architect who volunteers for the job. 
        With up to 60 hours of rehearsals at unearthly hours, peasant wages and 
        usually anonymity, they could be deemed the forgotten people. The spear-carrier 
        appellation hardly describes today's supers. Depending on regulations 
        and tradition, they may stand on stage with a spear, litter, knife or 
        camel's rein (ah, those poor, hot marchers in <em>Aida </em>!), or they 
        may roller-skate and fall off balustrades. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">They 
        are also at the mercy of both conductors and artists. Walter Hershman 
        of New York's City Opera noted how a famous tenor waited until the orchestra 
        was playing as loudly as possible to tell him: “If you stand in my light 
        once more, I'm going to push you into the orchestra pit.” </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Most 
        opera companies, even New York's Metropolitan Opera, lack a company of 
        supers and hire for each opera. Provincial companies like the Louisville 
        Opera company go to high schools or universities, where the kids are thrilled 
        to be on stage. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">The 
        supers of the San Francisco Opera obviously have the most fun since they 
        are all volunteers. They produce their own supernumerary newsletter, have 
        a rather closed community and can be on equal basis with the divas. Paul 
        Szczesiul recalls one opening act of <em>Tosca </em>, with the feisty 
        soprano Carol Vaness. “For no reason at all,” he says, “She suddenly mooned 
        us just before entering. The scene was a church, so we kept the laughter 
        to ourselves.” </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Against 
        this is the Canadian Opera Company, where supers are ordinary folk. “The 
        only talent, explains the super co-coordinator, Analee Stein, is being 
        non-union and fitting into our costumes.” Adds her partner, Liz Walker, 
        “You forgot patience and devotion.” For the money earned in the traditional 
        opera house, the last two are essential. In San Francisco, rates are $5 
        for rehearsals and $10 per performance. Yet the houses claim that their 
        supers will drive for hours just for this taste of show business. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Mark 
        Burstein (the aforesaid “apple tree” from <em>Mefistofele </em>) has been 
        a super for 10 years with no regrets. “We stand next to, over, sometimes 
        under the best singers in the business, with the best seat in the house,” 
        he says. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">European 
        opera houses keep lists of amateur supers, while the Royal Opera House 
        at London's Covent Garden insists on professional unionized actors and 
        offers union rates. In their recent <em>Bartered Bride </em>, the circus 
        performers came from, yes, the circus, where presumably even the horses 
        were organized. German houses keep lists of ‘‘Statisierie'' from which 
        the stage directors may call, but will recruit for very specialized parts 
        when needed. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">The 
        exception is New York's City Opera, which calls itself a theatrical stock 
        company, with seven supers, called “super mimes,” on seasonal contract. 
        </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Under 
        the aegis of the super coordinator, Kristen Gavner, these supernumeraries 
        individually specialize in fencing, character-acting, miming, stilt-walking 
        and just looking good. They train each other in their various specialties 
        and bring on, from New York's talent pool, ad-hoc players when necessary. 
        For Prokofiev's <em>Love for Three Oranges </em>, the supers included 
        two stilt-walkers, two musclemen, four jugglers and the usual attendants. 
        While not permitted to actually sing or dance, they can mime singing and 
        execute simple stylized steps. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Historically, 
        supers were dominant in the very first operas. Monteverdi specified “Servants, 
        Soldiers, Disciples of Seneca, Consuls, Tribunes, Senators, etc.” in his 
        1642 <em>Incoronazione di Poppea </em>. As the Sondheim of Venice, Monteverdi 
        would have attracted aristocrats and riffraff to run, not walk, to the 
        nearest gondola for an appearance at the ornate theater. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Twenty 
        years later, the Italian-French composer Lully wrote opera-ballets that 
        employed up to 100, mainly female, extras simply to look beautiful for 
        Louis XIV. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">But 
        the halcyon age of the supernumerary came two centuries later. When the 
        French librettist Eug&egrave;ne Scribe specified up to 600 extras in grand 
        spectacles written for Meyerbeer, Auber and Hal&eacute;vy. Music and drama 
        were on an equal basis with body sculpture and tableaux vivants. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">However, 
        the super does come back in unlikely places. The Canadian Opera Company 
        presented Stravinsky's <em>Oedipus Rex </em>, putting out a notice for 
        70 talented bodies — literally. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">“First, 
        they had to be dead bodies on a hill,” says Stein of the Canadian Opera 
        Company, “then all 70 had to be resurrected and become alive, then they 
        had to die once again. All of this without a hint of choreography, lest 
        the dancers' union complain.”</font></p>

        London</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">The 
        Stuttgart Opera audition for supernumeraries in Puccini's <em>Turandot 
        </em> this year called for “naked virgins, no singing or dancing permitted,” 
        but the producers didn't verify the one essential, and the other would 
        be camouflaged by makeup and gauze. These bare necessities are just one 
        of the unique talents demanded in the world of supernumeraries. New York's 
        Metropolitan Opera once had a call for “Super Nymph-Pushers,” who could 
        stand under the carts of goddesses for Strauss's <em>Ariadne auf Naxos 
        </em>. Stuttgart again pushed the envelope for an impoverished circus 
        for Smetana's <em>Bartered Bride </em> by calling for extras in the mammal 
        category: a dog that looked a little like a horse, and a flock of geese 
        that could follow a singer around the stage. Chicago's Lyric Opera outdid 
        even that when the super captain, Bill Waters, auditioned “lions, apes, 
        dinosaurs and rhinoceroses” for <em>The Magic Flute </em>. (Real mammals, 
        alas, are tone-deaf, so he settled for rhythmic teenagers.) </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Hardly 
        animal but certainly specialized supers are John and Alice Grimaldi, who 
        stilt-walk, eat fire, juggle, turn somersaults and are typical operatic 
        acrobats. While they perform in carnivals, medieval tournaments and children's 
        shows, they are regulars at the Metropolitan Opera and City Opera in New 
        York. Their operas include <em>Manon </em>, <em>La Boh&egrave;me </em>, 
        <em>Carmen </em>, <em>Love for Three Oranges </em>, and <em>Pagliacci 
        </em>, among others, and their lives can be fraught with mental and physical 
        danger. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">As 
        a fire-eater, John manipulated torches just a few feet from Jessye Norman, 
        not aware of her almost paranoid fear of fire. (“She took it in her stride, 
        only revealing her dread later,” says John.) In <em>Manon </em>, an otherwise 
        dignified Afghan hound was inspired to howl a duet with Ren&eacute;e Fleming 
        (the dog was diplomatically walked outside). Carts of supers in <em>Carmen 
        </em> were almost stalled by artificial spaghetti strands, and he had 
        to pick up the remnants while simultaneously juggling some rings. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Alice 
        Grimaldi had a more serious disaster this year as a stilt-walker in the 
        Met's <em>Manon </em> when a prop bench was moved, and she had an accident 
        that put her out for the season. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">“I 
        don't know who moved the bench,” Alice says, “but part of the problem 
        is that rehearsals for specialists have been cut, and we're in that gray 
        area of opera personnel, both in compensation and non-union protection.” 
        </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">City 
        Opera has the advantage of one long-time core of players teaching others. 
        So in <em>Intermezzo </em>, the resident skater, John Henry Thomas, disguised 
        roller-blades as ice-skates and taught three of his colleagues the fine 
        art of rolling to complex Strauss music around the chorus, dancers and 
        soloists. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Not 
        that specialty supernumeraries are without their problems. The ex-dancer 
        Raven Wilkinson, with the City Opera for a decade, had to relearn how 
        to walk like a character, not like a stylized dancer. And in her supernumerary 
        career, her problems are far different than those of any mere danseuse. 
        </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">“I 
        fell off an elephant in <em>Mefistofele </em>, had my nose broken as a 
        character mailbox in Foss's <em>Griffelkin </em> and was septically wounded 
        by the long toenails of a satanic rabbit in <em>Manon </em>, she says. 
        “But that's theater, and that's opera, and it's still total satisfaction.”
