      <p style="margin-top:0;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" style="color:black;">by 
        Andrew Korniej </font></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2" style="color:#FF6600;"><img src="images/Winzlerpics/lulu.jpg" width="152" height="228" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="right"></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Irrepressible, 
        incandescent Super and <a href="http://www.flaurel.com" target="_blank">Florist 
        Extraordinaire</a> Laurel Winzler and I met for lunch at Chow, on Church 
        Street, on a Friday afternoon in July. She had just returned from a trip 
        to Sweden and Russia, where she had attended performances at the <a href="http://www.mariinsky.ru/en" target="_blank">Mariinsky 
        Theatre</a>, part of the White Nights Festival. She didn't see any opera 
        there, only ballet. Nonetheless, she regaled me with funny stories about 
        traveling around St. Petersburg in a cab. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Like 
        many Supers, Laurel followed “The Calling” after pursuing a different 
        career in the arts; in her case, one in ballet and folk dancing. She has 
        been a performer and dancer most of her life, starting as a ballerina 
        at the age of five. Laurel came from a very musical Italian family, and 
        grew up with siblings who all played instruments and parents who were 
        devotees of the Metropolitan Opera broadcasts. Laurel is the only one 
        in her family who doesn't read music, but, ironically, she is the one 
        who now spends much of her time around musicians. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">It 
        was as a Hungarian-Balkan-Mexican folk dancer that she found a fulfilling 
        niche. She learned proper techniques while studying at Stanford University. 
        At that time, they had an excellent dance department, and classes were 
        held in a gymnasium across the street from her dorm, where she could take 
        a class every day. Dance training left her with a wonderful legacy, an 
        awareness of how to move, and when not to move, onstage. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Laurel 
        joined an ethnic dance troupe while living in Humboldt County. She moved 
        south, to San Francisco, in the mid-1980s. Frustrated by the lack of folk-dancing 
        opportunities in the Bay Area, she heard about supering and made an appointment 
        to meet the Super Captain, Fred Frumberg. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">“I 
        was expecting some Prussian martinet with a pencil-thin moustache,” she 
        remembers, “and then I arrived to find gorgeous Fred.” She was cast, alongside 
        stalwart supers such as Carolyn Waugh, Renee DeJarnatt, Traude Albert, 
        and Susan Anderson, as a Nibelung in the first complete cycle of Terry 
        McEwen's <em>Ring, </em>in 1985. She made an immediate friend in the head 
        of the costume department, Jenny Green. </font></p>
      <hr>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="3" style="color:red;"> 
        <em>“I'm actually in awe of my fellow Supers and company members. I get 
        very cranky when I don't get parts, because I don't get to hang with the 
        coolest people in town!</em></font><em><font size="2" style="color:red;"></font></em><font size="2" style="color:red;"><span class="spearhead">”</span></font> 
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">As 
        part of this original <em>Ring </em> staging, the AD, Dagmara, explained 
        in international terms that when the lights went up on their scene, she 
        wanted “ <em>Die Nibelungen </em>on the rock to look like <em>cucarachas.</em>” 
        After the first performance, the Supers were allowed to mingle with guests 
        at the opening-night gala, and General Director McEwen asked them to raise 
        their hands and identify themselves, which they did. At that point, a 
        patroness came over to Laurel and gushed, “You all looked <em>soooo </em> 
        disgusting. . . . You were like cockroaches.” Laurel hoped she would never 
        again have to wear a costume as unattractive as that first one. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Laurel 
        is a fearless performer with a “steady hand and nerves of steel,” and 
        she is frequently asked to dress or undress a production's diva, as was 
        the case during <em>Norma</em>, in 1998, starring SFO favorite Carol Vaness 
        in the title role. Ms. Vaness's costume was confusing, because every article 
        of clothing was made from the same material, making part identification 
        difficult. While Norma sang <em>Casta Diva </em>and her plaintive farewell 
        to her father and her people, Laurel and Ceci Valente bravely assembled 
        and disassembled the difficult Druid robes with split-second timing, and 
        with all eyes on them. Happily, they executed their mission flawlessly 
        during every performance. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2" style="color:red;"><img src="images/Winzlerpics/wardrobe.jpg" width="186" height="237" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="left"></font><font size="2">Laurel 
        has always enjoyed working with the wigs, makeup, props, and wardrobe 
        departments. She has been a demonstration model many times. The company 
        built a special corset to work with this costume from <em>Traviata, </em>which 
        has been employed at a number of donor events (<em>left</em>). When Laurel 
        saw the corset for the first time, she noticed that it was labeled size 
        XS. She pointed this out to Jenny, saying that the sizing must be an error. 
        Jenny responded with, “Poppet, in the world of opera, you <em>are </em> 
        an extra small.” </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">A 
        few seasons ago, the company used Laurel as the form for two body casts 
        representing Laura Aiken as the Angel in <em>Saint Francois D'Assise. 
        </em> “First, the costume shop made a plaster cast of my torso (to create 
        a shell that Ms. Aiken would wear over the flying harness she needed for 
        her out-of-window appearances), and then the prop department made a full 
        body cast to create a faux Angel that was supposed to fly across the stage 
        and burst into flames. After three hours of standing in a weird pose covered 
        with plaster and being told jokes and fed grapes and juice by the prop 
        guys, they cracked me out of it. They created this amazing blue creature 
        <font face="Times New Roman" size="2">— </font> and then the director 
        didn't like it and cut it from the show!!!!!” </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">“<font style="color:black;">The 
        blue angel cast was upstairs in the flys in the prop storage room&nbsp;last 
        I heard. I never saw it in its final form, but I heard it was quite wonderful. 
        It probably cost the company a lot of money to build, rig, re-rig repeatedly, 
        get fire permits in order to pull off the stunt, etc., etc. <font face="Times New Roman" size="2">— 
        </font> at least my time was a freebie.” </font></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><img src="images/Winzlerpics/Rigoletto.jpg" width="148" height="222" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="right"><font size="2">One 
        of Laurel's favorite costumes is the cleavage-revealing, faux-nipple-enhanced 
        gown from Act I of <em>Rigoletto </em>(<em>right</em>). During the fitting 
        process, she was amazed by the engineering that went into building a shelf 
        in the bodice to lift and separate. She has the strongest admiration for 
        the backstage craftspeople and “the phenomenal level of skill and artistry 
        that they put into their work.” </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Her 
        very favorite costume, however, was the Bob Mackie couture beaded gown 
        from the sensational 1989 three-act premiere production of Alban Berg's 
        <em>Lulu </em>(<em>picture at top of article</em>). Bob Mackie was at 
        the fitting and said, “It looks as though I made this for you.” The costume 
        was beautifully constructed, more so, even, than other costumes from the 
        production. At one point during the casino scene, she caught the dress 
        on a passing tenor at the roulette table. It was so well made, she didn't 
        lose a single bead. Laurel got to wear it again nine years later for a 
        revival of the production, and to Jenny Green's disbelief (“a triumph 
        of mind over matter, love”), it still fit. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em>Lulu 
        </em> comes to a blood-chilling climax with the eponymous character's 
        brutal murder at the hands of Jack the Ripper. As Lulu realizes what is 
        about to happen, she shouts, “Nein! nein! nein!” and as he stabs her, 
        she lets out a desperate scream. It's a great theatrical moment, but the 
        final scream in both '89 and '98 didn't come from Lulu, it came from Laurel, 
        in her only vocal moment onstage at the War Memorial. Lotfi Mansouri had 
        auditioned several Super ladies for the “role,” and Laurel won it with 
        “the most terrifying sound” Lotfi had ever heard, earning her the nickname 
        “The Screamer.” The Screamer got her own monitor and cue from the prompter's 
        box, but, naturally, no amplification. She reprised the big moment the 
        following year at a Symphony Pops concert conducted by Andrew Massey. 
        During the concert, The Screamer stepped out into the spotlight in big 
        earrings and taffeta, and after an announcement about “the sadness and 
        drama of Opera,” out came The Scream. Of course, it warranted a mention 
        in Herb Caen's column. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Laurel 
        has never been afraid to show a lot of flesh, but she has never revealed 
        all onstage. She was a part of the 1994 Ubiquitous Nude Season, appearing 
        in <em>Tannh&auml;user </em>and <em>Herodiade, </em>but she declined a 
        part in the habit-ripping finale of <em>The Fiery Angel </em>when she 
        learned that there would be no body stockings. Ironically, in the summer 
        of 2003, <font style="color:black;">the body-concealing nun's costume 
        in <em>Trovatore </em> “caused more than one company member to sidle up 
        and tell me how sexy I looked in that outfit <font face="Times New Roman" size="2">— 
        </font> naughty Catholic schoolboys, one and all!” It earned her the handle 
        of “Twisted Sister.” </font></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">During 
        the 1994 <em>Tannh&auml;user, </em>a provocative photo with Super Louis 
        Schilling appeared in the <em>Chronicle </em>Pink Section, and she enjoyed 
        pointing out that it was a picture of her with her bookkeeper. In <em>Herodiade, 
        </em>she appeared in three costumes in three scenes, including one as 
        a double for the then relatively unknown Renee Fleming, clad in a bejeweled 
        G-string. She remembers seeing a certain very famous tenor sneaking out 
        into the audience during rehearsals (in full costume<font style="color:black;"> 
        <font face="Times New Roman" size="2">— </font> </font>did he get a note?) 
        to watch the scene. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><img src="images/Winzlerpics/Placido.jpg" width="280" height="185" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="left">That 
        production was the last time Placido Domingo appeared in a fully staged 
        opera at SFO. Her association with the star has continued to be a pleasure. 
        Laurel and her sister were invited to visit him backstage after the 1999 
        <em>Three Tenors </em>concert in San Jose, and a few years ago, she enjoyed 
        a prominent role in the scene from Giordano's <em>Fedora </em> that opened 
        the Domingo Gala. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><img src="images/Winzlerpics/josecura.jpg" width="155" height="232" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="right">Laurel's 
        favorite voice types fall in the tenor to bass range, and she has a string 
        of anecdotes about singers with whom she has worked. During the Civic 
        Auditorium <em>Carmen, </em>she alternated in the role of Manuelita, the 
        Carmen-slashed cigarette girl in Act I. With each performance, the makeup 
        gash on her cheek became gorier and gorier. During the final performance, 
        the Don Jose, handsome Argentinean tenor Jose Cura (<em>right</em>), sat 
        her down onstage and whispered, “I have a friend in the audience who is 
        a plastic surgeon. I'm sure he could fix that.” </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">She 
        also speaks fondly of <a href="images/Winzlerpics/Hadley.jpg" target="_blank">Jerry 
        Hadley</a> (“the funniest person”), the late <a href="images/Winzlerpics/Ghiaurov.jpg" target="_blank">Nicolai 
        Ghiaurov</a>, and Jeffrey Wells. Of Samuel Ramey, she remembers the time 
        they were watching a ballgame on the props department's TV during <em>Don 
        Giovanni </em>. “At one point,” she recalls, “Sam heard his cue and said, 
        ‘I think I have to go sing. I'll be right back.' ” </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><img src="images/Winzlerpics/McCauley.jpg" width="157" height="249" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="left">But, 
        like another recent <em>Spearhead</em> interviewee, Joe Harris, she has 
        lasting but sad memories of the tenor Barry McCauley (<em>left</em>), 
        who sang here in both <em>Lulu </em> and <em>War and Peace. </em> “Barry 
        lost his voice and his career and ended up working in a dry-cleaning factory. 
        He had four kids to support, and even though he never smoked, he died 
        of lung cancer.” </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Laurel's 
        best “out of house” experiences have been at the Met, where she sat in 
        the house during a final dress rehearsal of <em>Susanna, </em> with Ramey, 
        Hadley, and Fleming (“a great production, it would be wonderful to do 
        in SF”); attended a staging rehearsal of <em>Pique Dame </em> and laughed 
        with Domingo over his struggles with the Russian text; and sat in the 
        General Director's box during a <em>Great Gatsby </em> performance, channeling 
        Rudolf Bing, and found a bent nail backstage to add to her collection. 
        </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">As 
        Laurel reflects on her years as a Super, she says that the hardest thing 
        has been watching the opera become “more corporate, more stressed,” with 
        less of the collegiality, parties, and “hanging out” that used to go on. 
        She remembers Supers being more active fund-raisers and the time they 
        collected money to purchase the Super Captain's computer. She misses the 
        many Supers who have gone: “Kermit” DuVal, <a href="images/Winzlerpics/newfoster.jpg" target="_blank">Ted 
        Foster</a>, <a href="images/Winzlerpics/Mishkin.jpg" target="_blank">Ian 
        Mishkin</a>, and especially Susan Mead, a “classy lady who called me up 
        from the hospice to thank me for flowers that Stephanie Salter had taken 
        to her. She ended up by comforting me.” </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">As 
        this very entertaining lunch ended, and I dashed off to avoid getting 
        a parking ticket on Market Street, Laurel started to say, “. . . and remind 
        me to tell you about the time in dressing room . . .” but her voice was 
        drowned out by a passing J Church bus, and the details would have to wait 
        for another lunch and the next installment of the Super Life of De-Lovely 
        De-Laurel. </font></p>
