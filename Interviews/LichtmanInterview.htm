      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><strong>The 
        Lichtman Cometh </strong></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><img src="images/lichtmanpics/Nabucco1%201.jpg" width="263" height="422" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="right">Charlie 
        Lichtman wears many hats. Literally, as he has been in 36 SFO productions 
        over the last seven years, and figuratively: actor, singer, “phone guy” 
        (designing telephone systems for homes, home offices and businesses), 
        playwright (<em><a href="../reviews/skitreview.html" target="_blank">The 
        Fractured Fedora</a></em>), lightwalker, Super Committee member for three 
        years, Production Super Captain. Herewith, a closer look at his Super 
        career. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">A 
        native New Yorker, Lichtman “took ten years of piano lessons as a child 
        and sang in the PS 82 Chorale (we sang at the 1964 World's Fair one time!)” 
        He went to Science High School and City College of New York, earning a 
        degree in Organic Chemistry. In 1972, he made the move to San Francisco. 
        </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Charlie 
        began going to the opera a mere twenty years later, during the 1992 season, 
        when “a friend of mine was complaining that her boyfriend wasn't much 
        of a cultural guy, so I got tickets for <em>L'Elisir d'Amore </em> and 
        <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>. I also got hooked.” </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Four 
        years later, he was at Opera in the Park in Yerba Buena Gardens. During 
        the intermission someone made an announcement about a call for new Supers, 
        mainly for <em>Carmen</em>. He went to the cattle call in the Ballet Building 
        and, although not making into <em>Carmen</em>, he did get cast in <em>Prince 
        Igor</em>.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"><img src="images/lichtmanpics/IGOR!%201.jpg" width="173" height="347" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="left">Of 
        all his r&ocirc;les over the years, this still remains his favorite. “It 
        was my first opera so everything was totally new to me. I had three different 
        costumes and was on stage at least an hour and a half – what a great first 
        experience! Every time I hear the overture on the radio I get goose bumps.” 
        As to <em>Carmen</em>, a recent production became his <em>least-</em>enjoyed 
        r&ocirc;le: “that fourth act behind-the-scenery parade with a 1&frac12;-second 
        peek and a wave to the audience through the archway. It seemed totally 
        pointless, although I did have a lot of laughs backstage with the other 
        Supers.” </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">When 
        he was asked “Which r&ocirc;le would you say represented you personally?”, 
        he replied “Probably <em>L'Elisir d'Amore </em> because my character was 
        one of Belcore's comical ‘farmer/soldiers,' and after all the serious 
        r&ocirc;les onstage, it was a breath of fresh air to be able to be funny. 
        I am already envious of the <em>Boh&egrave;me </em>waiters as they all 
        get pies in their faces at the end of Act 2 – now there's a part I wish 
        I had!” Anyone who has hung out with Charlie backstage knows of his wit 
        and gift for finding humor in various situations and appreciates knowing 
        that it translates onstage. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><img src="images/lichtmanpics/Rosenkav1%201.jpg" width="183" height="317" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="right">“I 
        do like being cast as a guard or soldier and, luckily, the repertoire 
        is full of those characters. Also, priests, slaves, townspeople, executioners, 
        peasants, Trojans, lackeys, and fishermen all have their particular appeal. 
        I have been lucky enough to have a few ‘cameo' parts: two in <em>Der Rosenkavalier</em>, 
        and in <em>Samson et Dalila</em>, I was lucky enough to be one of the 
        two soldiers to chain Samson to the pillars at the end of the show. I 
        also feel very important when I'm called upon to be a cover, since I am 
        obliged to learn many different parts. This really came to life in the 
        recent <em>Trovatore</em>, when I was the cover for 18 men, and went on 
        for final dress and 7 of the 8 performances. The other nice thing about 
        being a cover is that if you <em>don't </em> go on, you can see the show.” 
        </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Other 
        favorite onstage moments Charlie remembers are “the beautiful second act 
        sextet in <em>Don Giovanni </em> (we entered with the principals and had 
        no other stage business other than to stand and watch until the end of 
        the scene); the bar fight scene in <em>Otello </em> – 30 hours of fight 
        practice for 30 seconds of stage time, but it was totally fun; and the 
        goofy soldiers' entrance and scene in <em>L'Elisir d'Amore</em>.” </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><img src="images/lichtmanpics/JohnBaptist%201.jpg" width="182" height="259" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="left">Of 
        course, such moments are not without their unfortunate counterparts: “I 
        once got knocked on my nose by a descending piece of scenery during a 
        scene change late in the second act of the final dress of <em>Don Giovanni</em>. 
        Although I later found out that the entire incident was visible to the 
        audience, for me the stage was dark and I was knocked down to my knees. 
        Luckily we only had to place a chair, bow to Donna Anna, then leave, but 
        the look on Ron Mann's face when we turned to each other to exit was priceless. 
        I had a little stream of blood running down my nose, and had five minutes 
        to do a costume and wig change before the very last scene. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><a name="RosenMess"></a>“Among 
        the worst moments I've had onstage was on the opening night of <em>Rosenkavalier</em>, 
        during the ‘presentation of the rose' scene, when we were supposed to 
        be cued by off-stage ADs and ASMs. I don't think they knew the cues very 
        well, and we wound up looking like Keystone heyducks. We were able to 
        convince them to teach us the cues <em>musically</em>, and after that 
        the scene went totally correctly.” </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><img src="images/lichtmanpics/B2-6%201.jpg" width="146" height="419" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="right">Aside 
        from the many hats mentioned above, Lichtman has worn many costumes: “I 
        really liked the cut of my <em>Otello </em> soldier's costume; however, 
        I have to say I like nearly all of my costumes, no matter how uncomfortable 
        they may be (such as the ninja-turtle guard in <em>Turandot </em> and 
        the executioner in <em>Don Carlos</em>). Other costumes that really stand 
        out for me were my <em>Samson et Dalila </em> gold lam&eacute; Babylonian 
        soldier, and the Commedia del'Arte costume for <em>Betrothal in a Monastery 
        </em>. I actually got to buy the very costume I wore in <em>Norma </em> 
        in one of the opera's costume-shop sales. Among my <em>least </em> favorites 
        was the head-to-toe black rubber fisherman suit in <em>Kat'a Kabanova.</em>” 
        </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><a name="LoneRanger"></a>Asked 
        about some favorite backstage memories, he replied: “It was Sunday, November 
        2, 1997, the date of the opening performance of <em>Guillaume Tell</em>, 
        and it was a matin&eacute;e<em> </em> – one of those warm Indian Summer 
        days – so warm you're almost sorry you have to be in the opera house. 
        It was my second year of supering, and I was cast as an alternate. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">“Although 
        I did get to go on for three of the seven performances, everyone showed 
        up for the opening, and I thought I wouldn't get to be on stage that afternoon, 
        until Mark Burstein handed me a headband with some feathers and told me 
        that we were going to ‘streak the stage' during the overture. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><img src="images/lichtmanpics/tell02.jpg" width="191" height="282" hspace="2" vspace="2" align="left">“I 
        didn't quite get it until I saw Mark with his cowboy hat and mask, and 
        realized I had been conscripted to be Tonto to his Lone Ranger. Once the 
        ‘William Tell' overture began we made our way to the wings, and waited 
        until the horns heralded the well-known part; then Kimosabe and his faithful 
        companion slipped onto the stage. With the curtain in and the chorus preset 
        (and having secured the Stage Manager's permission), we galloped up the 
        ramp and down to the other side, looking for imaginary rustlers or flat 
        tenors, or something. As soon as we stood on the ramp, one of the techs 
        threw a spotlight on us and it followed us until we exited stage right 
        with a hearty “Hi-Ho, Silver!” amid much laughter.” </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Charlie 
        has also supered with the SF Symphony (<em>Candide</em>) and has had many 
        assignments with the SF Lyric Opera, including stage-managing a production 
        of <em>Carmen</em>, singing in the chorus of <em>Andrea Chenier</em>, 
        and singing the role of Happy the gold miner in <em>La Fanciulla del West</em>. 
        </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Asked 
        for advice for new Supers, he responded “Although it seems laid back, 
        being a Super requires a great deal of energy and concentration. I always 
        recommend having some food in your stomach before a rehearsal or performance, 
        even if it's only a chocolate bar or something. And <em>always </em> be 
        <em>very </em> careful backstage: the area is extremely complex and full 
        of accidents waiting to happen.” Asked why he supers, Charlie said “I 
        find it very interesting experiencing a production going from nothing 
        to a complete opera. I find it exhilarating being a part of it, and being 
        so close to principals and surrounded by music. My non-opera friends call 
        my involvement with SFO my ‘parallel universe', and they're <em>so </em>glad 
        I have many Super friends with whom I can talk about opera, thus sparing 
        them from a very one-sided conversation.” </font></p>
