      <p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0"><strong><font size="2">Tom Reed</font></strong>, 
        chorister extraordinaire</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">by 
        Tom Carlisle</font></p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0;"><br>
        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Tom Terrific&quot; 
        was born in Newport, Rhode Island, and raised in Westchester, Pennsylvania, 
        a town of over 18,000 approximately 25 miles due west of Philadelphia. 
        He actually grew up on the outskirts of town in the beautiful wooded rolling 
        hills we associate as Andrew Wyeth country, where there are Pennsylvania 
        Dutch, covered bridges and fox hunting. (Foxes would sometimes ran to 
        him for solace and comfort.) These formative years must be why Tom today 
        is such a friendly, smiling and open individual. <br>
        <br>
        Tom acquired his love of singing from his parents, though neither were 
        professional singers. His father was a very good vocalist and guitar player, 
        while his mother had a lovely voice, but didn&#8217;t have the courage 
        to sing out. <img src="/Interviews/images/tomreedpics/portrait.jpg" width="275" height="413" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="left">She 
        had been discouraged in school when told at an early age just to mouth 
        the words. It was his mother who loved his voice and encouraged Tom to 
        sing. He joined the church choir when he was six as a soprano (unusual, 
        in that tenors generally start out as altos.) He also had a vibrato, again 
        unusual for a child. It was his father&#8217;s last and greatest joy, 
        just before he passed away, when Tom told him that he had been accepted 
        as a chorus member of the San Francisco Opera. Tom has one sister now 
        who teaches in the field of applied psycholinguistics at Boston University, 
        and who has just published a textbook on pronunciation for teachers and 
        students of English as a second language.<br>
        <br>
        After high school Tom went to college for one year in Opa-Locka, Florida, 
        just north of Miami, studying history before he joined the Navy. His service 
        time took him to the Great Lakes Naval Training Station, Pensacola, Hawaii, 
        and eventually Vietnam. His training was in advanced electronics, but 
        he was also singing in the Navy Blue Jackets Choir at Great Lakes Naval 
        Station, where he was also a soloist. Because he believed that his future 
        would always be in electronics, Tom never sought professional vocal training. 
        He is just doin&#8217; what comes naturally!<br>
        <br>
        After the navy, Tom moved to San Francisco in 1972. That year he started 
        to sing with the chorus of Saint Mary&#8217;s Cathedral while working 
        at a wide range of jobs, such as at Wells Fargo Bank, a residence club, 
        and at a railroad company called the Pacific Fruit Express (&#8220;giggle!&#8221;). 
        It was in 1974 that a fellow choir member told Tom about being hired by 
        the San Francisco Opera and actually being paid to sing. Tom had absolutely 
        no knowledge of opera at the time &#8211; having only seen one performance 
        in his life &#8211; when he auditioned for the chorus in 1975. Therefore 
        his choice for the audition was rather bizarre, a soprano aria from <strong>Faur&eacute;</strong>&#8217;s 
        <em>Requiem </em> in Latin, no less (not at all appropriate for opera). 
        However the Gods were smiling down on him at the time, for he found out 
        later that the then chorusmaster, <strong>Bobby Jones</strong>, was a 
        former monk! Tom was accepted into the regular chorus in 1975. He also 
        continued to sing with the St. Mary&#8217;s choir as a cantor and soloist 
        for a total of nine years.<br>
        <br>
        He loves singing in the chorus because, as he says, it&#8217;s just like 
        being back in school, except this time he is popular and is doing well. 
        Tom never wanted the life of a soloist. He only wanted to find love and 
        to settle down, which he has now done successfully, sharing his life with 
        his partner <strong>Ed Miller</strong> for two decades.<br>
        <br>
        With the opera chorus, Tom is a <a href="../SecondTenors.htm">second tenor</a>, 
        the lower of the tenor parts. He once auditioned to be a cover in <strong>Monteverdi</strong>&#8217;s 
        <em>Il Ritorno d&#8217;Ulisse In Patria</em> in 1990 and got it. But he 
        prefers the many character roles he has had over the years, such as the 
        innkeeper in <em>Falstaff</em>, Papa McCourt in <em>The Ballad Of Baby 
        Doe</em>, and the idiot policeman in <em>Lady</em><em> Macbeth Of Mtsensk</em> 
        under the demanding direction of <strong>Johannes Schaff</strong>. Tom 
        claims that he is always cast as the idiot something or other. <br>
        <br>
        He is crazy for Russian opera and has loved every one we have ever done, 
        as well as the standard repertoire of <strong>Verdi</strong> and <strong>Puccini</strong>. 
        He also loved <strong>Philip Glass</strong>&#8217;s <em>Satyagraha in 
        1990</em>, a killer to sing, and also last year&#8217;s <em>Le Grand Macabre</em>. 
        One of Tom&#8217;s most memorable roles was as a male stripper-nun in 
        <strong>Berlioz</strong>&#8217; <em>La Damnation De Faust</em> in which 
        he wore prosthetic boobs and butt that got ripped off during the performance 
        (on purpose). <br>
        <br>
        Tom does not like to be in operas with a lot of bravura posing, which 
        he says makes him look silly, nor <img src="/Interviews/images/tomreedpics/portrait2.jpg" width="275" height="413" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="right">operas 
        where the chorus is only filler, though he may like to watch these works. 
        Once he was supposed to rape one of the ballerinas in <em>William Tell</em> 
        as part of the action, and all she did was giggle. Tom loves being one 
        of the Lehrbuben in <em>Die Meistersinger</em>, and describes himself 
        as &#8220;the oldest &#8216;Lehrboob&#8217; in the biz.&#8221; He can 
        do perky! One of the most challenging roles to sing in the operas we have 
        offered to date was in the aforementioned <em>Satyagraha</em>, which required 
        all the tenors to sing staccato high A&#8217;s continuously and where 
        one&#8217;s throat would lock-up (clamp down). They all experienced this 
        and some had to drop out of the musical phrase for a while to adjust before 
        coming back in. <br>
        <br>
        His hardest physical stint was in the <em>Lohengrin</em> at the Civic 
        Auditorium, standing (as many of us did) for one-and-one-quarter hours 
        at attention, and in part of that with a 6-foot-long trumpet resting on 
        his shoulder and playing in his ear. Another of his favorite operas is 
        <em>Peter Grimes</em>, particularly the production of 1976 with <strong>Jon 
        Vickers</strong> bursting into the tavern scene and scaring the daylights 
        out of everyone on stage.<br>
        <br>
        As for unusual things happening to him on stage during performances, Tom 
        remembers when he drew loud gasps from the audience for an unscripted 
        fall in a production of <em>La Forza del Destino</em>. In a war scene, 
        the chorus men were instructed to race across the stage, which was covered 
        with straw. Several of them fell down, including Tom, who was carrying 
        a flag. For the next performance, the costume shop put gunk on the bottoms 
        of their shoes for better traction, except that this time, instead of 
        falling they all picked up the loose straw on the bottoms of their shoes 
        and were practically running on bales of hay by the time they got to the 
        other side of the stage.<br>
        <br>
        In <em>Norma</em> in 1977, Tom was carrying a flaming torch while standing 
        near <strong>Joan Sutherland</strong> just as she began singing the &quot;Casta 
        Diva.&quot; The torch went out (the old model) and fell in on itself and 
        started to smoke, which of course headed straight for Dame Joan. He didn&#8217;t 
        know what to do, stay on and pickle her or go off and upstage her. He 
        stayed until the end of the aria. Just before the next performance, <strong>Paula 
        Williams</strong> drew him aside and said she had a message for Tom from 
        Dame Joan. If the torch began to smoke again he had Sutherland&#8217;s 
        permission to leave the stage.<br>
        <br>
        In other fun bits of stage action, not pertaining to him, would include 
        the 1984 <em>Ernani</em> (a crushing bore, he found), in which the entire 
        male chorus was unimaginatively lined up in two straight lines clear across 
        the stage on two risers. Upon a musical cue, they were all to take one 
        step forward and raise their swords. Unfortunately, the tallest chorister 
        stepped just two inches too far and fell off the platform, landing hard 
        on the main deck &#8211; his sword banging loudly into the stage floor. 
        He quickly composed himself and stepped back up onto the riser, but left 
        a shoe on deck below. The entire chorus, still trying to stand at attention, 
        was breaking up with laughter and unable to sing.<br>
        <br>
        By far the wildest event that I have heard occurring on stage during a 
        performance sounds as if it were right out of an episode of <em>I Love 
        Lucy</em>. It seems that in the 2001 production of <em>Arshak II</em> 
        there were eight chorus men preset on a balcony center stage where a tarp 
        would drop from the wall, revealing the eight saluting <strong>King Arshak</strong> 
        with their swords. They were dressed as <em>satraps</em> with huge black 
        turbans which had bushy black hair sewn into them. They looked ridiculous 
        enough to start with, but during one performance the falling tarp caught 
        and whisked off the turban of one of the choristers, exposing a completely 
        bald head. He was heard exclaiming quite audibly, &#8220;Oh Jesus Christ&#8221; 
        as he ducked down behind the balcony wall to retrieve his hat. This would 
        have been funny enough, but then he popped back up just as they were about 
        to sing, with the turban on the wrong way around and the fuzzy black hair 
        in his face. Even members of the orchestra were pointing and laughing 
        at the spectacle, as the eight struggled for a seeming eternity to maintain 
        composure.<br>
        <br>
        As noted earlier, Tom is a great admirer of the fabulous tenor Jon Vickers, 
        as well as <strong>Montserrat Caball&eacute;</strong>. Her <em>Turandot</em> 
        in 1977 with <strong>Pavarotti</strong> was mindblowing. She once adjusted 
        Tom's costume backstage before going on, and when he said, &#8220;Oh, 
        Miss Caball&eacute;! What an honor!&#8221;, she replied, &#8220;Oh, don&#8217; 
        beee theeeley&#8221; in her shimmering Castilian voice. However, Tom is 
        also in awe of any famous singer who can remain humble, accessible and 
        just a plain decent person in spite of all of the accolades.<br>
        <br>
        Tom is deeply appreciative of the Supers and enjoys working with them. 
        He says that in them he has a captive audience for his bizarre sense of 
        humor. They amaze him with their commitment to the long hours and the 
        hard work with little compensation for their efforts, and he is always 
        pleased to see a scene where the Supers have special action and are really 
        involved in the work.<br>
        <br>
        I am afraid I stumped him when I asked about his hobbies, and he finally 
        admitted to gardening, hunting gophers, and downing carbohydrates. But 
        his real and most valuable (to us) hobby is writing marvelous and insightful 
        reviews and backstage goings-on for &quot;<a href="../funstuff/ReedSection.htm">The 
        Reed Section</a>.&quot; The idea popped into his head about 10 years ago, 
        when at first it was just jokes from rehearsals, off-the-wall things, 
        ridiculous yet with a sense of truth, which he sent online to a few friends. 
        Today it has grown to full opera reviews and goes out to about 110 people 
        all over the world but mostly in the U.S.) Sometimes it gets a little 
        too political and he was recently asked by one person to be dropped from 
        the list. Tom has also written an article for last season&#8217;s <em>Der 
        Fliegende Holl&auml;nder</em> program as requested by <strong>Claire Myers</strong> 
        of the PR department. It dealt with the rehearsal process for the chorus 
        and how they handle the memorization and staging of the operas. It was 
        done with a bit of humor, but also again with truth. For example, in one 
        opera the curtain went up with the chorus trying to balance themselves 
        on one knee with one arm extended, followed by so-called &#8220;operobics&#8221; 
        to music.<br>
        <br>
        This brings us to the outstanding article he wrote about his experiences 
        getting a marriage license with his partner Ed Miller in February 2004 
        at City Hall. His friends on the e-mail list wanted him to publish it 
        immediately, and <strong>Stephanie Salter</strong> suggested that he submit 
        it to the <em>Chronicle</em>. It turned out to be just what they were 
        looking for. You can still read it on the <em>Chronicle</em> <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/02/22/LVGPM53H861.DTL" target="_blank">website.</a>Tom 
        was expecting to find the paparazzi swarming outside his front door the 
        morning that it was published when he came out to pick up the paper, but 
        says he was greatly disappointed to find only a soggy newspaper in the 
        rain. He then slipped and fell on a banana slug.<br>
        <br>
        As for the future, his only wish is to be able to retire at his own discretion 
        before they kick him out. Tom is excited about the possibilities suggested 
        by our new General Director designate, <strong>David Gockley</strong>, 
        when he, David, talks about expansions. This could mean new seasons, new 
        venues, new recordings and telecasts or other concepts that haven&#8217;t 
        even been thought of. There are so many of our productions that should 
        have been telecast in the past, says Tom.<br>
        <br>
        Looking forward to the fall season, Tom believes there is some great music 
        to be had. <em>Doctor Atomic</em> is really quite listenable, at least 
        as far as he can tell from the chorus parts with piano. It is sometimes 
        quite chilling to sing or declaim the actual historical dialog of the 
        planning sessions for the bombing raids, as in one scene in which they 
        are discussing the bombing of the city of <strong>Kyoto</strong>, which 
        was the primary target ahead of <strong>Nagasaki</strong>, but later changed. 
        Tom has been to Kyoto, and it is hard for him to imagine that the Golden 
        Pagoda and all of the other ancient temples might have been long gone. 
        Yet on the other hand, Tom&#8217;s father was with the Marines in the 
        Pacific, and had the war not ended when it did, his father might have 
        died in the invasion of Japan, and Tom would not be here today to think 
        about it.<br>
        <br>
        Tom thinks about his 30 years as a member of the chorus and the many people, 
        choristers, principals, Supers and all of the others who have at some 
        point in time appeared on this stage in so many marvelous events in such 
        a confined space. He says that in some other dimension, that small stage 
        must be very large indeed.</font></p>
