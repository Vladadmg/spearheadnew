      <p align="center" style="margin-top:0;"><font face="Verdana" size="4"><strong><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Opera
            Has Been Verdi, Verdi Good to Him </font></strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images/TomC03.jpg" width="212" height="318" hspace="0" vspace="0" align="Right">When <strong>Tom
            Carlisle</strong> was just ten years old, he was sent on a bus trip
            from Columbus, Ohio, to Cincinnati to visit his grandmother. She
            took him to the Cincinnati Zoo Opera--the “zoo” referring to the
            location of the venue (a tent within the municipal zoo) rather than
            the performers. (It was a quite reputable company and featured, over
            the years, such stars as Lily Pons and Ezio Pinza.) Little Tom’s
            grandmother, a “skinflint,” made them sit outside and then sneak
            in at intermission. Here a lifetime passion was born.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tom
          was graduated from Ohio State--after a year at Tulane University in
          New Orleans--with
          a degree in architecture. He then volunteered for a three-year stint
          in the Army, getting into their language school and spending the next
          year in Monterey, California, learning Czech and visiting our opera
          company on weekends. Towards the end of his tour of duty he was sent
          to Germany to monitor the Czech airwaves, and stayed in Europe an additional
          four years, attending the Academy of Applied Arts in Vienna which had,
          of course, the premier opera company. Tom saw operas in “over 150 cities,
          each with their own companies,” including Munich, Frankfurt, Nuremberg,
          and Bayreuth. He estimates he saw about 100 operas a year for the four
          years he remained in Europe. </font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Having fallen in
          love with California in his Monterey stint, he came back to San Francisco
          in 1963 and got a job with an architectural firm, and served with several
          others until his retirement in 1995. </font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tom’s
          supering career began a few years later, in 1969, when a friend recommended
          him to Super Captain Madeline Chase, but that year he only did two
          performances of <em>Aida </em> as an alternate. Two years later, a
          friend from his Vienna days was scheduled be one of the <em>Meistersinger</em>s.
          Tom wanted to surprise him onstage, and did so during the first rehearsal. </font></p>
      <p style="margin-top:0;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images/TomC02.jpg" width="212" height="318" hspace="6" vspace="6" border="0" align="Left"></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since those days,
          Tom has supered in forty-four different operas, often in several distinct
          productions, including,
          he remarked, “every single <em>Bohème</em>, save one.” One of his favorite
          operas is <em>Boris Godunov: </em> Having begun as a log-roller, he
          was promoted to a priest in a subsequent production (Tom has played
          many a cleric) and worked his way up the ecclesiastical ladder, reaching
          a climax in the ’92 production when he played the Patriarch (picture
          at left).</font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some of his favorite
          roles include a staged <em>St. Matthew’s Passion </em> (Spring Opera, ’76)
          where he was a Pharisee; <em>Werther </em> where he was a minister
          who gave a sermon behind a stained glass window (the director wanted
          him to recite the same text every night so Tom obliged by memorizing
          Cyrano’s “nose” monologue--in French!); <em>Khovanshchina, </em> as
          one of the “old believers” attached to Robert Lloyd, and a <em>Luisa
          Miller </em> where he was shot on stage. Other memories include Dame
          Kiri Te Kanawa once stroking his hair offstage during an <em>Arabella </em> (he
          was the headwaiter) and once during a rehearsal quite literally bumping
          into Dame Joan Sutherland on the bridge between the stage and the auditorium. </font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The few lowlights
          of his career: the costume he was forced to wear during a long-ago <em>Faust</em>, “goggles
          and a rubber mask, carrying a flaming torch and trying to find my way
          up the crowded stairs from below stage when no one could see where
          they were going”; and once, in a Stern Grove <em>Butterfly</em>, as
          a servant carrying Pinkerton’s luggage, kicking off a sandal--which
          landed in the orchestra pit. </font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All this led up
          to his signature role--none other than Giuseppe Verdi <img src="images/TomC01.jpg" width="214" height="324" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="Right">himself!
          Somewhere around January, 2001, while manning the switchboard, he was
          noticed <em>en passant </em> by either Paolo Gavanelli, who was to
          play the title role in <em>Simon Boccanegra</em>, or its director,
          David Edwards (accounts differ). Alerted to the possibility by Lotfi
          Mansouri (“Don’t cut your hair or shave. We may need you in <em>Boccanegra</em>”),
          Tom (who even without makeup bears a startling resemblance to his hero)
          got to portray the esteemed composer during the Verdi Celebration in
          the summer of ’01. After several weeks of special rehearsals with David
          Edwards, Tom began appearing onstage. Many of the cast and crew reported
          feeling goosebumps when they first saw him in costume and makeup, as
          he was the very incarnation of the Maestro. Although his entrances
          were eventually cut from ten to three, they were indelibly memorable
          moments for both him and, most importantly, the audience. Tom particularly
          remembers his final moments onstage during Boccanegra’s death scene,
          as Gavanelli would look up into his eyes, which often brought Tom to
          the point of tears. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tom has also been
          very active with the Super Committee and the Opera. He started out
          doing some volunteer
          work in the mailroom in ’96, which eventually led to a paid part-time
          position running the switchboard. He has served on the Committee for
          three terms, which included being the editor of the <em>Spearhead </em> (print
          edition) for the last six years. Tom has run a few Bake Sales and is
          famous for his extraordinarily creative assemblage of the Super Scrapbook,
          a project begun after the ’96 <em>Bohème </em> at the Orpheum. His
          own personal scrapbook goes back to his Vienna opera-going days and
          is quite voluminous. He also collects opera recordings, both vinyl
          and CD. </font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tom’s
          all-time favorite diva is Elizabeth Schwartzkopf, whom he has heard
          perform
          here in this house, in Vienna, and, on a golden long-ago day, in Columbus. </font></p>
