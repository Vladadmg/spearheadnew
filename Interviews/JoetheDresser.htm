        and the Secrets of Room 11</strong></font><font size="2"><strong><font color="#FF0000"><br>

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em>The 
        upcoming spring season marks a very significant transition at the San 
        Francisco Opera. The performance of </em>Doktor Faust <em> on Sunday, 
        July 3rd, will be the last day that dresser Joe Harris works at the Opera 
        before leaving on retirement. To mark the occasion, the </em>Spearhead 
        <em> invited Joe to lunch to gather some history and perspective on a 
        44-season career as dresser, confidante and friend to the leading men 
        of the San Francisco Opera. </em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Anyone 
        who has made an entrance through the stage left door has seen Joe outside 
        Dressing Room 11 wearing “George Burns” (I was about to say “Edith Head”) 
        glasses and beaming encouragingly at the performers about to make their 
        entrances. He likes to think of the area outside of Room 11 as the nerve 
        center of the Opera's activity, where everybody goes by and everything 
        happens. Not only do the singers, chorus, and Supers go onstage from there, 
        but well-wishers, some of them very famous, gather outside, waiting to 
        meet their tenor idols. Room 11 is only a few feet from where the now 
        defunct Rehearsal Department was, and Opera management and board members 
        enter the auditorium by passing that door, discussing sensitive subjects 
        as they go. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">We 
        met at his delightful, airy new garden apartment in Laurel Heights before 
        moving on to the charming Sociale restaurant a few blocks away, where 
        he is a regular patron. He moved into the apartment only three months 
        ago, after selling the house that he and his late partner, Jay Deck, bought 
        together during their 47-year relationship. The space is filled with autographed 
        opera memorabilia, souvenirs of his travels, and paintings and drawings 
        by many artist friends. Spread throughout are interesting early works 
        by his longtime friend, the renowned painter Wayne Thiebaud, including 
        a series of stage designs and a remarkable portrait, drawn from life, 
        of the French actor and director (<em>Les Enfants du Paradis</em>) Jean-Louis 
        Barrault. </font></p>
      <h1 class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Early 
        Days </font></h1>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">It 
        doesn't take much prompting to get Joe to reminisce about working at the 
        Opera. He told Mike Harvey and me a few stories off the record, as well 
        as many more that were for publication. He has an obvious and deep love 
        of his work, a tremendous respect for all levels of performer, and mischievous 
        memories of the great characters—of the Adler years especially. Each anecdote 
        is illustrated with humor and descriptive gestures and each ends with 
        Joe assuming the character, expressions and voice of the subject of the 
        story. However, he has no time for cruel or unkind behavior from his colleagues 
        and does not hesitate to point out intolerance or grandiosity. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Joe 
        started his career as a dresser when a friend, Jack Cook, called him in 
        January, 1961. Jack was working for a touring company from London's Old 
        Vic Theatre, which was in San Francisco performing <em>Macbeth</em>, Shaw's 
        <em>St. Joan</em>, and a Franco Zefferelli production of <em>Romeo and 
        Juliet </em> starring the “young and beautiful” British stage actor John 
        Stride. Jack didn't have enough men to dress the actors so he asked Joe 
        and Jay if they were interested. They were, even though they were both 
        employed teaching drama—Joe at George Washington High School— they took 
        the extra work, calling in sick at their respective schools whenever they 
        were needed to work the matinees. <img src="images/JoeHarristenors/Luciano1.jpg" width="251" height="188" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="left"></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">That 
        fall, Joe was assigned to work for the Opera, dressing Supers. Jay followed 
        a year later. At that time the Supers were dressed in the corridor that 
        now houses the orchestra men's lockers. They had set up a long makeup 
        table where Rex Rogers and his assistants would do the Supers and chorus. 
        There were benches in front of the costume racks and our less pampered 
        predecessors had to undress there, regardless of who might walk by, and 
        leave their street clothes on the benches. The head of wardrobe in the 
        early Sixties was a “card-carrying crazy” named Craig Hampton, and working 
        with him was a friend of Joe's, John Blauer, who had spent some time at 
        Goldstein's, the SFO costume makers. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Mr. 
        Hampton apparently liked to treat our less fortunate forebears as cretins 
        and one time had them all get into their shabby <em>popolo </em> costumes 
        and form a line. “I want you all to know that you are a ragtag bunch of 
        people, so you look good this way. Remember that these costumes belong 
        to the company and you must take good care of them.” At that he marched 
        off, leaving the Supers dumbstruck. John Blauer then started in a sympathetic 
        voice “Now, you have to understand that Craig spent the war in a German 
        prisoner of war camp … <em>as a guard</em>! </font></p>
      <h1 class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Jess 
        Thomas et al.</font></h1>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Joe 
        only dressed Supers for one season, although Jay dressed us until his 
        retirement in 1985. Joe went on to work with the chorus, then the <em>comprimari, 
        </em> and then moved up to the second floor where he dressed, among others, 
        Nicola Rossi-Lemeni, Ettore Bastiannini, and Victor Braun. He then moved 
        up in the world, albeit back down the stairs, to Dressing Room 11, thanks 
        to the intervention of the great <em>Heldentenor </em> Jess Thomas. In 
        1967 Jess was singing <em>Tristan und Isolde </em>with mezzo-soprano Irene 
        Dalis, a close friend of Joe's since their student days in Italy in 1951. 
        </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Back 
        then there were no electronic paging systems and no call sheets. Cues 
        were kept by an “electronic genius” by the name of Sandor Maibaum, who 
        hand-wrote them in a notebook. The Room 11 dresser, at that time a Mr. 
        Annini, was a member of the Merola family and probably held the job on 
        the strength of that connection. Both of these men suffered from poor 
        physical health, so Joe spent a lot of time running up and down the stage-left 
        staircase, paging people and checking cues. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Jess 
        Thomas was a very commanding figure, and he felt that the current dresser 
        would not be up to the challenge of dressing him so, on Irene Dalis' recommendation, 
        he insisted on Joe, and there he has remained, working both Opera and 
        Ballet seasons. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Jess 
        Thomas and Joe remained friends until Mr. Thomas' death. His last performance 
        in opera was at the War Memorial on December 6th, 1981. General Director 
        Kurt Herbert Adler called him one Sunday morning at 11 to take over the 
        role of Siegmund in a performance of <em>Die Walk&uuml;re </em>—starting 
        at 1 that very afternoon! The scheduled singer had suddenly been taken 
        ill. Mr. Thomas protested that he hadn't even shaved, but was “ordered” 
        to do so on the way into the city from his home in Tiburon. He arrived, 
        got into costume, and the curtain went up as scheduled. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">As 
        a dresser, Joe was sometimes privy to some very unfortunate scenes. When 
        Maestro Adler swept in to talk to a tenor who had been ill-prepared to 
        sing the role of <em>Lohengrin</em>, Joe feared the worst. “You always 
        knew there was trouble when Adler began with 'I'm sorry but …'</font> 
        <font size="2">&quot; He tried to leave the room, but couldn't. Adler 
        told the hapless tenor that he “was finished—your contract is null and 
        void—we will pay you off—just get out of this House!” and left the would-be 
        Swan Knight cursing him <em>en fran&ccedil;ais</em>. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Mr. 
        Adler was not without some helpful advice, however. One particularly memorable 
        tip was how to get on the good side of Birgit Nilsson. “Take some beer 
        to the curtain calls for her.” Joe did and the <em>Hochdramatischer Sopran 
        </em> immediately fell in love with him. <img src="images/JoeHarristenors/bergonzi.jpg" width="308" height="217" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="left"></font></p>
      <h1 class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Wardrobe 
        Malfunctions </font></h1>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Joe 
        witnessed, and salvaged, quite a few costume failures, one of the most 
        memorable being Geraint Evans' Papageno costume in <em>Die Zauberfl&ouml;te</em>, 
        composed of thousands of feathers. As the costume gave way in the back, 
        shedding feathers and revealing a white t-shirt, Mr. Adler stood in the 
        wings panicking, but Joe calmly reassured him and skillfully managed to 
        patch the plucked birdcatcher. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">During 
        a performance of <em>The Merry Widow</em>, Dame Joan Sutherland made her 
        entrance down a very grand staircase to much inappropriate laughter from 
        the audience. She began her aria, but the laughter continued. She finished 
        singing and headed back up the stairs, gathering up the unraveled parts 
        of her costume as she went. She had caught the costume on a rough edge 
        during her entrance. Upon exiting the stage, she used her favorite expletive 
        and, while people threw safety pins in his direction, Joe made enough 
        repairs to the back of the costume to get her back onstage. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Joe 
        fondly remembers Joan as a trooper taking these things with good humor. 
        During a performance of <em>Trovatore </em> he remembers her coming offstage 
        after her difficult Act One aria and confiding to him “That's really hard 
        for a little old coloratura soprano.”</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Then 
        there was the time that Joe was dressing tenor Nicolai Gedda when his 
        <em>Manon </em>co-star Beverly Sills put her head around the door and 
        advised, “Nick, remember that when you get out on the stage I'm the big 
        redhead on the swing …” </font></p>
      <h1 class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Balletomane 
        </font></h1>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">In 
        Room 11 Joe often had to work with touring ballet companies such as ABT, 
        including the period when Mikhail Baryshnikov was dancing with them. “Baryshnikov 
        was always fun to work with, in contrast to Nureyev, who was certifiably 
        crazy.” On another High Drama occasion, <a href="http://www.mistersf.com/notorious/index.html?notnureyev.htm" target="_blank">Rudolf 
        Nureyev</a> was flown in for a <em>Swan Lake </em> with Natalia Makarova, 
        neither having danced with each other in three or four years. <img src="/Interviews/images/JoeHarristenors/Nureyev.jpg" width="195" height="268" align="right">There 
        was no time for rehearsal and Nureyev no longer remembered the choreography. 
        Joe was told to meet him as he came offstage in one scene—but no one knew 
        which side that would be. He ran from wing to wing—trying to follow the 
        dancer as he leapt in one direction after another—carrying a “cigarette 
        girl” tray of sewing materials around his neck and Rudolf's eight-pound, 
        solid gold wristwatch (a gift from a Greek shipping magnate) which the 
        star refused to leave in the dressing room. Either by chance, or his instinctive 
        good judgment, Joe ended up on the same side of the stage as the Temperamental 
        One when he finally made his exit. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Joe's 
        involvement with the ballet, extends beyond dressing its stars. He has 
        written librettos to four ballet productions. Three were for Ballet West 
        in Salt Lake City, including <em>White Mourning</em>, set to Mahler's 
        treatment of Schubert's <em>Death and the Maiden</em>, and <em>Ophelia, 
        </em> an adaptation of <em>Hamlet </em> which ended with Ophelia's death 
        by drowning. In February 1991 he wrote the libretto for a new SF Ballet 
        production of Stravinsky's <em>Pulcinella</em>. Joe set the ballet (originally 
        designed by Picasso for the Ballet Russe) in a contemporary Italian railway 
        station; it received outstanding reviews. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><strong>Three 
        Tenors and Other Celebrities </strong></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><img src="images/JoeHarristenors/Luciano2.jpg" width="271" height="206" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="left">As 
        Joe says “you never knew who was going to knock on the door of Room 11. 
        One time, a young Italian tenor was making his debut and had attracted 
        the attention of the Italian Consulate. There was a knock on the door, 
        I opened it, and there was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0556399/bio" target="_blank">Giulietta 
        Masina</a>.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">During 
        another season, Joe was dressing Pavarotti for <em>Boh&egrave;me</em>,<em> 
        </em> and while they were waiting for his Act 3 entrance, there was another 
        knock and a voice outside saying “There's someone here to see Mr. Pavarotti, 
        and I think he won't mind.” The door opened and “in swept Ginger Rogers 
        in a full-length mink coat. She immediately fell to her knees in front 
        of Luciano and thanked him for all the pleasure he had given her and millions 
        of others. She swept back out, and Luciano turned to me and said 'Was 
        that who I think it was?'” </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Later 
        in that same run Joe mentioned that Paul Newman was outside, <img src="/Interviews/images/JoeHarristenors/pavorattinewman.jpg" width="179" height="219" hspace="4" align="right">and 
        would Luciano mind having a photo taken with him? Celebrity-struck Pavarotti 
        beamed and replied “But of course” stepped outside and graciously posed 
        with a long-time Super and Newman namesake (right). </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">It 
        was also during <em>Boh&egrave;me </em> that Pavarotti celebrated his 
        34th birthday. During the Caf&eacute; Momus scene, Kurt Adler (supering 
        in a waiter's uniform) presented him with a bottle of real champagne onstage 
        and wished him a Happy Birthday. Pavarotti was noticeably shocked. Joe 
        had been informed that the boys' chorus would be outside Room 11 waiting 
        to sing “Happy Birthday” after the curtain calls, so he went ahead and 
        gently opened the stage left door so that the great tenor wouldn't knock 
        over some unfortunate boy soprano in his hurry to get back to the dressing 
        room. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Joe 
        qualified as a <em>bona fide </em> Super when Jose Carreras, appearing 
        as Gustavus in a <img src="images/JoeHarristenors/carrerasonstage.jpg" width="177" height="264" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="right">1977 
        restored-to-Sweden <em>Ballo, </em> insisted that he be his costumed onstage 
        dresser in one scene (right). He reluctantly agreed and, as a Super, Joe's 
        dresser was, of course, his partner Jay. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Joe 
        was on duty, naturally, for Opening Night of the 1983 Season, the night 
        Placido Domingo <img src="images/JoeHarristenors/domingoponelle.jpg" width="201" height="287" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="left">(shown 
        at left with designer Jean-Pierre Ponnelle [L] and Joe [R]) was flown 
        in from the East Coast on a few hours' notice to sing <em>Otello </em> 
        when the scheduled tenor (can anyone remember his name?)* fell sick. “Fortunately,&quot; 
        said Joe, “Placido's costumes were still around and hadn't been altered, 
        and he hadn't gained any weight, so they were just brought over for us 
        and they worked. The curtain didn't go up until 10:30 at night, the performance 
        ended at 2:45 am, after which there were the usual Opening Night parties 
        and then Sunday's Opera in the Park. Probably nobody went to bed at all 
        that night.” </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">And 
        when asked “Who is Joe Harris' favorite tenor?” he reflects for a few 
        minutes as though running through the names of the hundreds of great performers 
        he has worked with and contemplating decades of great memories, before 
        settling, eventually, on “Placido: He is very macho, very Spanish, and 
        though he would never be physical in front of other people, as soon as 
        there's no one else around we just throw our arms around each other.”

        younger, post-Adler generations of tenors, he qualifies this selection 
        by saying “I love and feel really close to many other singers, too: Marcello 
        Giordani, David Daniels (right)—he calls me every week and really went 
        out of his way to make sure that I got the VIP treatment at Glimmerglass 
        one year—and Frank Lopardo (whom he is looking forward to seeing again 
        during the spring <em>Boh&egrave;mes</em>), Juan Diego Florez, and especially 
        Richard Margison. Then there is Jay Hunter Morris, who always calls himself 
        ‘Your Jay.' &quot;</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Joe 
        is approaching retirement with a little trepidation, afraid that he won't 
        have enough to do. However, right now he has plans to “work on a book, 
        not a kiss-and-tell, though,” and to take a Mediterranean cruise. He goes 
        to the JCC gym three times a week, is dating again, and recently worked 
        as an artist's model. As we walked back from the restaurant, Mike and 
        I were able to reassure “Dresser Joe” that having enough to do would <em>not 
        </em>be a problem.</font></p>
