        in the Light</font></strong></p>
      <p align="left" class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><img src="images/Spotlight.GIF" width="96" height="98" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="left"><span class="spearhead">Lightwalking 
        is a valuable way to contribute to SFOpera productions.</span></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Lightwalkers 
        stand, squat or sit onstage in lieu of performers for three or four hours 
        while directors and lighting designers finesse visual effects, and on 
        occasion staging ideas and choreography, using real, live dolls. There 
        is no substitute for the reflective properties of flesh and blood. </p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lightwalkers 
        receive direction from the darkened house and, in response, move around 
        the set like pieces on a chessboard. Understanding the terms <em> stage 
        left, stage right, upstage, </em> and <em> downstage </em> and having 
        an infinite reservoir of patience are the only requirements for a healthy 
        lightwalking experience. <br>
        <br>
        A vigorous imagination provides amusement while you wait for cues from 
        the creative team. Give free rein to operatic fantasies while you stand 
        obediently in the spotlight. Be a Surrogate Salome, Stand-in Siegfried 
        or Doppelg&auml;nger Don Giovanni. Trod the boards upon which your heroes 
        and heroines pose, warble, flop, and caress. Relish in your heart of hearts 
        the fact that you are standing in lights that beam upon the likes of Fleming, 
        Domingo, and Ramey.</p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><em>In bocca 
        al lupo!</em> And no snoring! </p>

      <p align="left" class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aside 
        from being a great asset to the technical and production staff, Lightwalkers 
        earn credits that may be used to attend dress rehearsals (on occasion, 
        dress rehearsals may be closed to anyone but production staff). Each lightwalking 
        session attended is worth one credit. After two credits, Lightwalkers 
        have earned enough credits to attend one dress rehearsal. Credits are 
        non-transferable, so only the Lightwalker him/herself may cash in the 
        credits.</p>
      <p align="left" class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;">The 
        dress rehearsal dates are posted on the <a href="dramaturg.html">member's 
        page</a> and on the Lightwalker/Super sign-in board, which is located 
        down the hall from the North Stage Door guard station. (The dates are 
        posted only during opera season.) When two credits have been earned, send 
        me an <a href="mailto:abusch@sfopera.com">email</a> at or leave a message 
        at (415) 551-6281 (email preferred) and let me know you want to attend. 
        During some busy times of the year, I may not be able to confirm that 
        I've received your request to attend, but please assume that your message 
        has been received, and that you have been added to the list. The list 
        is normally located at the North Carriage Entrance of the Opera House, 
        which is where Lightwalkers should enter for a dress rehearsal. Please 
        do not attend a dress rehearsal unless you have notified me that you are 
        attending.</p>
      <p align="left" class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;">In 
        the past Lightwalkers who put in enough hours have been invited to the 
        Volunteer Appreciation Party, which is held during the fall. This has 
        slipped through the cracks for the past few seasons, so I will be reinstituting 
        that benefit. I'm going to attempt to be more conscientious about putting 
        the sign-in sheets on the board, so please be sure to sign in when you 
        arrive for your lightwalking session. The number of hours one has to volunteer 
        to be invited to the party is yet to be determined, but I will announce 
        that at a later date.</p>
      <p align="left" class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thank 
        you for your continuing help with lighting rehearsals. Everyone from the 
        lighting crew to production staff to me appreciates the time you donate; 
        especially because we see how much schedule flexibility you repeatedly 
        demonstrate. San Francisco Opera is very lucky to have such a dedicated 
        corps of Lightwalkers.</p>
      <p align="left" class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;">If 
        you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. </p>
      <p align="left" class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"> 
        Best wishes,</p>
