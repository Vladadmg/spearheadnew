        Finale</strong><br>
        <br>
        The 2004 fall opera season went out with the bang of a burst balloon this 
        weekend at another triumphal <a href="/events/party2004/Superpartyintro.html">Super 
        Party and Skit</a>, and with SFO Supers showing up all over the national 
        media. <br>
        <br>
        <strong> Mmm Mmm Mmm</strong>.<br>
        <br>
        The party (for those who were not there) was once again held in the Conference 
        Center at Fort Mason with a capacity crowd of 150 Supers and guests. It 
        is the perfect space for our gathering accessible, spacious and with stunning 
        views.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"><img src="/funstuff/images/Ulrica12/buffet.jpg" width="294" height="158"></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">The 
        food was sensational; a menu of stuffed chicken breasts over a medallion 
        of herby stuffing accompanied by a colorful medley of seasonal roast vegetables. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Ulrica almost had to be physically restrained from going back for thirds 
        but decorum won out and she managed to allow others their share of the 
        feast. Brava <strong>Susan Anderson</strong> for finding the caterers 
        and Bravi Tutti <strong><a href="http://www.intimate-catering.com/home.html" target="_blank">Intimate 
        Catering</a></strong> for doing such an incredible and efficient job. 
        Vegan Super <strong>Sergio Suhett</strong> and his partner <strong>Jon 
        Carr</strong> were impressed by the personal attention they received from 
        the chef, who whipped up special vegan plates for them both.<br>
        <br>
        The Super Committee members were industry personified. Scant seconds went 
        by before Susan or <strong>Sally Warren</strong> would whisk away an abandoned 
        dinner plate. <strong>Irene Bechtel</strong> and <strong>Joan Imbeau</strong> 
        handled the admissions table with customary efficiency and charm, and 
        Steve Lavezzolli and Bruce McNaughton (didn&#8217;t he leave town already?) 
        were the handsome bartenders; apparently very generous in their pouring. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Ulrica was appalled at the sight of her own intoxicated sister, <strong>Stregata</strong>, 
        being unceremoniously bundled into a carriage, spouting a particularly 
        salty stream of adjectives at the doorman and driver as they drove her 
        away to another 28-Day Program.<br>
        <br>
        Of course, Stregata is famous for being 86ed from only the best places 
        and her fishwife vocabulary may well have been inspired by the distinctly 
        nautical theme of this year&#8217;s Super festivities. Not only did we 
        have that beautiful view of the Bay and Golden Gate (yachts gently bobbing&#8230;) 
        but Super playwright <strong>Charlie Lichtman</strong> concocted a brilliant 
        parody of this season&#8217;s seafaring fare; especially the re-telling 
        of <em>Billy Budd</em> in &#8220;the way we all wished it had been written&#8221;.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"><img src="/funstuff/images/Ulrica12/charlie_skit.jpg" width="295" height="196"><br>
        The opening Rossinian ensemble &quot;Comp Night at the Opera&quot; segued 
        into the Prelude from <em>La Traviata</em> as the &quot;Patron from Hell&quot; 
        (the enigmatic and exotic <strong>Madame Glinka</strong>), <img src="/funstuff/images/Ulrica12/glinka.jpg" width="167" height="150" align="left">her escort 
      and her doggy bag from Chevy&#8217;s Tex Mex uproariously took their seats.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;"><font size="2">Gorgeously attired <strong>Priscilla
            Lore</strong> then made an announcement 
        that &#8220;Photography is strictly forbidden &#8230; but as these are
         only Supers feel free to flash away.&#8221;<br>
        <br>
        Producer/director/author Charlie had installed a proscenium with curtain
         with the help of his friends at Acme Scenery (motto: &quot;We Build Anything&quot;)
         for scene changes and with the backstage cueing of Stage Manager <strong>Albert 
        Goodwyn</strong> (nice to have him working with us again), the performance
        ran smoothly and uproariously. No need for a review here, you can write
        your own &#8211; almost the entire skit was taped by Michael Strickland&#8217;s 
        partner, Tony Hurd, posted as a &quot;&#8216;streaming video&quot; (with
        appropriate framing) and can be <a href="/events/party2004/Superpartyintro.html">viewed</a> from
        these pages. I&#8217;m told that bootleg DVD copies are already hitting 
        Ebay. The missing section (attributed to operator error) conveniently 
        includes Captain Vere&#8217;s embarrassing lapses of memory but Ulrica 
        has no reason to believe rumors that the Starry Captain paid dearly to 
        have those compromising minutes of tape &#8220;misplaced&#8221;. <br>
        <br>
        But look for the many highlights which included<img src="/funstuff/images/Ulrica12/billy.jpg" width="281" height="390" vspace="5"> <strong>Paul Szczesiul</strong>&#8217;s

        or the <strong>Stephanie Salter</strong> Whine Award. We&#8217;ll all

          it did include <strong>Carrie Murphy</strong>&#8217;s thank-you speech

        The thank-yous included a big one to Party benefactor <strong>Rudy Cook,</strong> 
        who got an ovation worthy of Placido Domingo for his generous donation, 
        another to <strong>Paul Newman</strong> for securing the Fort Mason venue 
        gratis, and to everyone who PSCed this year (and you know who you are). 
        Carrie was looking fabulous, sporting a purple chiffon wrap and a natural 
        hair color (and we all thought she was a blonde). It also included acknowledgements 
        from Paul (&#8220;Thank you everyone who baked something for a bake sale&#8221;) 
        and, of course, the Hammy Awards; once again cheerfully crafted by Super 
        artisan <strong>John Janonis</strong>.<br>
        <br>
        Hammy Awards were given out to <em>La Boheme</em>&#8217;s <strong>John 
        F. Martin</strong> for his Musetta-bound flying plate; to <em>Traviata</em>&#8217;s 
        <strong>Steve Bauman</strong> for not returning from an offstage trip 
        to the champagne fountain; to the five <em>Dutchman</em> Super women who 
        never even made it <img src="/funstuff/images/Ulrica12/derek.jpg" width="154" height="170" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">onstage, 
        but did make it into the program of another opera altogether; to first

        The entire event could not have moved more smoothly nor more efficiently, 
        from set up to strike, and could not have been more fun, from arrival 
        to departure. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Closing Nights</strong><br>
        <br>
        The latter days of this fall season were not without interest. <br>
        <br>
        The last show of Super-extravaganza <em>Tosca</em> saw <strong>Pamela 
        Rosenberg</strong> and <strong>Brad Trexell</strong> holding up Olympiad 
        final score cards (perfect tens!) as <strong>Carol Vaness </strong>made 
        her final leap from the Castle Sant Angelo parapets.<br>
        <br>
        The performances of <em>Eugene Onegin</em> had debuting Super <strong>Nicolas 
        Papaiconomou </strong>named on the cast list and taking a solo curtain 
        call for his amusingly distracted second to Onegin, Guillot, in the Act 
        2 duel scene.<br>
        <br>
        Adler Fellow&#8217;s <strong>Lucas Meachem</strong> took the role of Onegin 
        for the December 9th performance, a performance that built to an especially 
        harrowing climax in Tatyana&#8217;s shoe closet. The pre-performance announcement 
        that Mr. Meachem was filling in for an ailing colleague was confidently 
        made, onstage, by our very own Carrie Murphy.<br>
        <br>
        <em>The Future is Ours</em> at Herbst Theater on December 8th had extraordinarily 
        thrilling performances from eight Adler Fellows, including <strong>Thomas 
        Glenn</strong>&#8217;s chilling &#8220;Miles&#8221; from <em>The Turn 
        of the Screw</em>, <strong>Ricardo Herrera</strong>&#8217;s Rachmaniov 
        aria and Super fave <strong>Joshua Bloom</strong>&#8217;s very accomplished 
        and mature &#8220;Elle ne m&#8217;aime pas!&#8221; from <em>Don Carlos</em>.<br>
        <br>
        Trooper <strong>Alec Page</strong>&#8217;s brief run on and run off in 
        <em>Onegin</em> added to that scene&#8217;s sense of movement exponentially. 
        Too bad they didn&#8217;t utilize him more. <br>
        Very mixed reactions to that production&#8217;s ostentatious pyrotechnic 
        chandelier, its robotoid ballroom movements, and the dancing haystacks 
        in Act 1. No doubt extensive research led Herr Direktor to discover this 
        quaint Russian folk dance but really, didn&#8217;t they just look like 
        hyper-caffeinated old floor mops?<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Sara Jobin</strong> took up the baton again for one Dutchman performance and, again, 
        got enormous applause and cheers from her claque in the orchestra seating. 
        Ulrica saw the show three times and thinks that might have been the best 
        one&#8230;<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Media Blitz</strong><br>
        <br>
        The December issue of <em>Opera News</em> is all about SFO Supers. Not 
        only do the <em>Cosi</em> Supers get special mention but two Supers get 
        their photo in the same issue.<br>
        <br>
        In the review of <em>Cosi</em> by <strong>Georgia Rowe</strong>, &quot;It 
        was all <br>
        brightly colored and festive, yet Cox allowed intermittent glimpses into 
        the increasing reality of the era: the crisp military uniforms seen at 
        the start of the evening gave way to <strong>soldiers on crutches and 
        sisters in nurses uniforms</strong> by the end of Act I.&quot;<br>
        <img src="/funstuff/images/Ulrica12/operanewsjoe.jpg" width="277" height="194" vspace="5"><br>
        And here is the picture that appeared on p.32 in a piece called &quot;<em>In 
        the Parisian Style</em>&quot; that shows <strong>Joe Giammarco</strong> 
        as well as Paul Szczesiul (in <br>
        shadow).<br>
        <br>
        The long-awaited &quot;60 Minute&quot; <a href="events/60min.htm">segment</a> 
        on soprano phenomenon <strong>Anna Netrebko</strong> finally aired on 
        December 12th and those who caught it say that Maitre D&#8217; <strong>Andrew 
        Korniej</strong> and waiter Sergio Suhett can be seen with the glamorous 
        one in shots from last Summer&#8217;s <em>La Boheme</em>. Thanks to <strong>Pat 
        Beresford</strong> and <strong>Rob Wonder</strong> for alerting Ulrica 
        to that! Her TIVO was unfortunately on the blink that day and she missed 
        it.<br>
        <br>
        If you can&#8217;t wait until June to see Supers onstage go and check 
        out the new SF Ballet <em>Nutcracker</em> and look for returning Nutcrackers 
        <strong>Katherine Brazaitis</strong> and <strong>Louis Schilling</strong>.

        Charlie Lichtman was surfing channels recently when he came upon an old 
        <em>Cagney and Lacey</em> episode. The two women were on the heels of 
        a murder suspect who was an aspiring actor. They track down his agent 
        who tells them he was last seen working at &#8220;the Opera.&#8221; Off 
        go the two to said opera house to question the staff there. One pithy 
        administrator tells the girls that the suspect was &#8220;a Super.&#8221;&#8220;So 
        he cleans the place?&#8221; observes Cagney. &#8220;Oh no&#8221;, replies 
        Pithy, &#8220;he was a Supernumerary.&#8221;&#8220;Have you talked to 
        him recently?&#8221; asks Lacey. &#8220;Of course not,&#8221; lisps Pithy, 
        &#8220;we never fraternize with those people&#8221;. It&#8217;s easy to 
        imagine that the script was written by one of us.<br>

        At the end of the year, with the Holidays approaching and still basking 
        in the glow of the Super Party, Ulrica takes a pensive moment to reflect 
        on what a unique community we have among the SFO Supernumeraries. Can 
        any other opera company boast such a great group? Probably not, as we 
        so often hear from visiting performers and directors that SFO has the 
        best, most diligent Supers.<br>
        <br>
        Can any other Company&#8217;s Supers have such great communications, starting 
        with the old photocopied <em>Spearhead</em>s? This website just gets better 
        and better and the level of professionalism of the photography and web 
        design gets higher and higher.<br>
        <br>
        We are supportive of each others&#8217; work and efforts, sympathize with 
        lost roles, applaud each others&#8217; triumphs and laugh along with our 
        own mishaps. We mostly see each other for only a few weeks out of the 
        year, sometimes not working with people we have known for years for several 
        seasons, but always pick up our friendships and alliances as if we&#8217;d 
        never left off.<br>
        We are a community of equals, knowing that today&#8217;s featured performer 
        will be tomorrow&#8217;s three-second walk-on. We accept whatever is offered 
        us with good grace and humor and approach the smallest, most obscure part 
        with the gusto we give to the most prominent. It&#8217;s a rare Super 
        who isn&#8217;t happy when a fellow Super gets their moment in the spotlight.<br>
        <br>
        Although recent seasons have been lean ones for Super roles, and economically 
        lean for the company as a whole, we have nevertheless continued to show 
        up to lightwalk, to volunteer and, now, to take on the responsibilities 
        of Production Super Captains. And if we ever feel under-appreciated we 
        can comfort ourselves with the knowledge that no matter how hard we are 
        to spot onstage, there is a fellow Super out there in the audience who 
        has his or her binoculars trained on us alone.<br>
        <br>
        It is an honor and a privilege to belong to this group, and after 15 seasons 
        I never cease to be amazed at our devotion to the unique, fragile and 
        esoteric world of the Opera Supernumerary. <br>
