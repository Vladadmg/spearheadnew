             Schilling </strong> appeared (and stole the show) in Wendy Wasserstein's
              hit <em>The Sisters Rosensweig</em>, which opened on Broadway in
              1992.  The play was performed at the Douglas Morrisson Theatre
              in Hayward this 
        summer. The action takes place in London, on the occasion of the eldest
               sister's 54th birthday. Louis played Geoffrey Duncan, the sexually
              ambiguous 
        boyfriend of Pfeni, the middle sister. His flamboyant portrayal of the
               character lit the stage whenever he appeared, especially at the
              opening 
        of the second act, when, reprising (or parodying) that well known scene
               in <em>Risky Business</em>, he sang and danced to “Can't Help
               Myself,” 
        costumed in red socks, a black tank top, and silk boxers. Performing
        his lines with an appropriate British accent, Louis gave a completely
        entertaining
        performance. </font></p>

      <p class="spearhead"><font size="2"><strong>Grove 
        Wiley </strong>(the artist formerly known as <strong>Albert Malkin) </strong>is 
        currently appearing as “Death” in the avant-garde production of a new 
        play, <em>Daughter of the Floods</em>, at the Embarcadero Auto Showroom 
        in North Beach. The 14 “Scenes and Archetypes” bring to life the cards 
        of the Tarot. The Director's notes state that “…choosing to create a show 
        around these Trump cards came from an unrelenting desire to explore the 
        diverse and contradictory aspects of the self, and a need to understand, 
        or rather an attempt to accept, without judgment, the polarities of human 
        nature.” The character of the piece is decidedly feminist, and the 18 
        performers are assisted by techniques of movement, lighting, and creative 
        minimalist staging as they progress through the scenes. Flesh-colored 
        body suits and occasional bare breasts enhance the sensuality of the piece. 
        Spoken dialogue is sparse but effective; however, other vocalizations, 
        including screaming, shrieking, giggling, and bird calls fill the house 
        with a primal ambiance. Masks are used very effectively to reflect the 
        characters. And through almost every scene is Death…appropriately clad 
        in black with a black mask, occasionally disarming the audience by peering 
        directly into their eyes. <br>
