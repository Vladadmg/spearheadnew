      <p align="center" class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><strong>Super 
        Committee in Action &nbsp; </strong></font></p>
      <p align="left" class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">The 
        Super Committee held its monthly meeting on September 29th, with Susan 
        Anderson as Chair and all eight members of the Committee, but without 
        Carrie who had to work, unfortunately. &nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        Everyone was very pleased with the results of our <em>Magic Flute</em> 
        <a href="funstuff/Vault/Ulrica5.htm" target="_blank">bake sale</a>. There 
        had been some worries that with so few Supers in the opera we might not 
        get enough contributions but that was far from the case and, as you know, 
        over $600 was raised. &nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        Since the Opera announced its budget deficit, there has been discussion 
        among Supers as to how we can help the Company at this financially difficult 
        time. The idea that gained the most ground was to host an open house with 
        a backstage tour and various other attractions to which we might invite 
        our friends and families as a fundraiser. The idea gained some favor with 
        the Development Department, although there was some concern that we might 
        be approaching some of the same donors that they are, which they would 
        like to avoid. Both Todd and Carrie were supportive of the idea and a 
        subcommittee was formed. Three members of that subcommittee took the Opera 
        Guild backstage tour and found it to be very impressive and something 
        that we would have to match or improve upon in order to attract people. 
        Also there would have to be some outlay of cash to stage such an event. 
        &nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        For that reason, and after further discussion, we reluctantly decided 
        to table the idea. Other ideas, on a smaller scale, have been suggested, 
        including a January bake sale with all proceeds going to the House, but 
        they have yet to be decided on. We have stressed to the House, however, 
        our willingness, as Supers, to participate in any fundraising events that 
        they might be staging, and the Supers who canvassed the crowd at Opera 
        in the Park were doing just that. &nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        On a more positive and productive note, we have been doing a lot of work 
        on the <a href="events/events.html" target="_blank">Annual Party</a>. 
        Invitations will be going out this week both by email and regular mail; 
        Mimi Timberlake will be coordinating the catering and comparing a number 
        of bids we have received for the food. This year we have to ask for a 
        small donation to help cover the costs because we don't have as much money 
        in the Super Fund as we did last year and the reaction to catering the 
        event seems to be unanimously positive. Please be aware that the $10 donation 
        we are asking for is only half the per-head catering charge we are considering, 
        not to mention the cost of drinks and of renting the room. All the great 
        effort that is put into our fundraisers by you, such as bake sales, pays 
        for the rest. &nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        Susan also addressed a couple of questions that Supers had asked to be 
        brought up before the committee. One of these was the problem of parking. 
        Unfortunately, we are unable to secure parking permits for Supers and 
        the House has asked that we don't use the official lots. Questions about 
        scheduling were raised. One of the aims of Spearheadnews.com is to give 
        accurate and up-to-date schedules for the operas; Charlie Lichtman has 
        been doing a very thorough job of keeping track of changes. Although rehearsals 
        are, by their very nature, subject to change and every attempt is made 
        to avoid changes, there are times when Supers are called but not used 
        during a rehearsal. With both these issues we hope you can be patient, 
        a virtue that is essential to being a Super. &nbsp; <br>
        <br>

        27 th and if you have any issues you would like to raise please let any 
        committee member know about it, or <a href="mailto:akorniejsupers@yahoo.com">email 
        us</a> and we'll bring them to the committee's attention.</font> </p>
