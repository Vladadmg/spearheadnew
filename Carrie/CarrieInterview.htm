        by Andrew Korniej </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em>As 
        a member of the Super Committee it has fallen on me, on a number of occasions, 
        to explain the changes in the duties of the new Super Coordinator, which 
        are very different from previous years. I thought it would be worthwhile 
        to have that person, the very affable and witty Carrie Murphy, help explain 
        the changes and her responsibilities. </em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em>With 
        this in mind Carrie and I met in a 24th Street taqueria towards the end 
        of the 2003 fall season. </em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em>AK: 
        Carrie, tell us where you're from. </em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">CM: 
        I'm from a town near Denver called Indian Hills. I left there nine years 
        ago and arrived in San Francisco that October. I went to school in Southern 
        Colorado, studying acting, theater arts and speech communication as a 
        minor. I was trained classically as a singer, sang in choruses and did 
        some opera workshops. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em>AK: 
        How did you come to the San Francisco Opera? </em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">CM: 
        I started at SFO as the Opera Center Administrative Assistant and Auditions 
        Coordinator. In January of 2002 Brad Trexell (the Opera's Artistic Administrator) 
        hired me as his assistant. I help with contacting agents, contracting 
        the singers and all the stuff that comes from working in the Artistic 
        Department. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em>AK: 
        What exactly does the Artistic Department do? </em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">CM: 
        The Department is the liaison between artists or their agents and the 
        company. It handles contracts, housing and travel, auditions and, of course, 
        casts Supers. We don't deal with the chorus though. That is its own entity. 
        </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em>AK: 
        Well it's nice to know that we Supers fall under the artistic umbrella. 
        How and when did you end up working with the Supers and is it easy? </em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">CM: 
        I was asked if I'd like to do it during a period of downsizing, last summer, 
        when Todd Calvin moved into Scheduling. It can be very difficult; very 
        involved and time intensive and I didn't get any training from my predecessor. 
        The biggest challenge is trying to balance coordinating the Supers while 
        assisting my boss. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em>AK: 
        Tell us how hard it can be… </em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">CM: 
        The most difficult, totally stressful thing was trying to find one person 
        who could stand on his or her head on a Vespa for <em>The Barber of Seville 
        </em>. I called an audition and only one person showed up who could do 
        it -- but the director wanted more choice so we ended up hiring an acrobat. 
        Getting 51 people to do <em>Don Carlos </em> was much easier! </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><em><font size="2">AK: 
        Have you ever wanted to become a Super? </font></em></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">CM: 
        (emphatically) No! </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><em><font size="2">AK: 
        So how do we Supers get roles? </font></em></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">CM: 
        The casting starts with the Costume Department sending over a list of 
        costume sizes. Then I go through the database and take people whose sizes 
        match and I show the list to the Assistant Directors. Meanwhile the Director 
        is telling us what he wants and then I have to find out if those Supers 
        are even available to do it. I do try and make sure that as many people 
        get stage time as possible. I want to keep people interested in doing 
        it, even when there isn't much available, so that when they are needed 
        they will still be around. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><em><font size="2">AK: 
        If I call you repeatedly will that help me get a good Super role? How 
        about email? </font></em></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">CM: 
        (laughs) As any one who works around me knows I hate getting phone calls! 
        They do take me away from the other things I need to get done, and working 
        two different jobs means using two different parts of my brain. &nbsp; 
        I hope people realize that there are 450 people on the roster and that 
        you aren't the only one calling or emailing. Having said that, though, 
        the squeaky wheel does get the grease, but emailing me is much better. 
        I always read my email. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><em><font size="2">AK: 
        Can you tell us something about the duties of the volunteer Production 
        Super Captain? </font></em></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">CM: 
        The PSCs help keep me sane. They help with schedule changes and to disseminate 
        information from the Assistant Directors to the show's Supers, such as 
        venue and call times. They also oversee sign-in and make sure I get the 
        correct information to issue the checks. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><em><font size="2">AK: 
        Why are the ASMs and ADs always telling us what to do? Don't they realize 
        that we're </font></em><font size="2">artistes<em>, volunteering our time? 
        </em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">CM: 
        (laughs)Their job is to tell everyone what to do, principals as well, 
        and they are to be obeyed at all times! This is a team event and the Supers 
        are very important. In terms of aesthetics, and to make sure the whole 
        show works, they can be as important as the singers. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><em><font size="2">AK: 
        Why are there so many backstage rules and regulations? </font></em></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">CM: 
        They are part of the evolution of making the opera more streamlined. Everybody 
        takes this very seriously, especially Wardrobe and Makeup, so don't mess 
        with them. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><em><font size="2">AK: 
        If I have to miss a performance should I tell you in advance or should 
        I wait until the last minute? </font></em></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">CM: 
        Tell me yesterday! </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><em><font size="2">AK: 
        As Super Coordinator you must get some free time when there aren't any 
        Supers in a show. What do you do with all that free time? </font></em></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">CM: 
        I am in the theater chasing rugged stagehands. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><em><font size="2">AK: 
        Will there be many Super opportunities this summer? How about fall 2004? 
        </font></em></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">CM: 
        Apart from the return of <em>La <font style="color:black;">Boh&egrave;me</font></em>, 
        no. There may be a couple of roles in <em>Doktor Faust</em> but the director 
        has very specific requirements for those. <em>Cunning Little Vixen</em> 
        will be using dancers. I haven't started to look at the fall operas yet. 
        </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><em><font size="2">AK: 
        Carrie, do you enjoy working with Supers? </font></em></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">CM: 
        Yes I do. You are really great people and I'm inspired by your commitment 
        to the company and to opera. Supers are so much less jaded than many other 
        company members and I continue to be amazed by Supers and by your involvement 
        and willingness to help and just how much you accomplish. </font></p>

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">CM:
