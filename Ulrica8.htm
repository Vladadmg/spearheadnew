        were broken at yesterday's steamy Bake Sale Espa&ntilde;ol, held during 
        the opening of <em>Don Carlos, </em> with a staggering $885 taken in! 
        As memory serves, the previous high was $700+ at last season's <em>Turandot</em>. 
        Buyers were clamoring for baked goodies half an hour before the official 
        opening time and by noon a line stretched out the door, along the corridor 
        and possibly into the auditorium. Supers excelled themselves with contributions 
        including beef stroganoff, Tom Carlisle's paella, Lisa Lorea's meatball 
        tapas, Larry Hunnicutt's corn bread fiesta and Joan Kwansa's crisp green 
        salad. </font></p>

        Bake Sale of 2003 on Sunday November 16th, at another <em>Don Carlos </em>

              all-purpose cutie-pie Marco Armiliato will be out of the SFO rotation 
              for at least the next 2 seasons. The current administration failed

              when he is tentatively set to conduct the opening night </em>Ballo 
              in Maschera<em> . Our loss is his gain -- in the interim, he will 
              be doing opening night in Vienna among other plum assignments in 
              Europe and at the Met. In the meantime, we can catch him on the 
              Met broadcast of </em>Rigoletto<em>, in a cast featuring another

        He sounded great, and was in good spirits afterwards. The famous Ramey 
        hair is grayer (a new baby can do that to you!) and more controlled, but 
        he is as trim and lively as ever. He confided that he has no upcoming

        up next season. That would be Kathleen Edwards, whose patience, humor 
        and attention grabbing, backstage gyrations will be much missed. Kathleen 
        will surely be going on to great things elsewhere but she has been a great 
        friend to us Supers and we hope to be able to bid her a fond farewell

        of us go to great lengths to fulfill our obligations as Supers. A few 
        years ago Irene Bechtle turned down an offer of a nun's role in the Disney 
        mega-hit “Sister Act,” which was filming in Noe Valley, to be a Super. 
        Irene had a part in that year's outing of <em>Carmen </em> alongside her 
        husband and her son, Richard. Not wanting to break up the family group, 
        Irene forfeited the chance to bop along with Whoopi Goldberg, instead 
        waving from a balcony, half-hidden behind the supertitles, during the 
        brief Act IV parade. That is devotion to supering. </font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Susan Anderson's 
        own devotion to the opera extends far beyond buying the occasional standing 
        room ticket. If you have ever wondered where our fake beards and moustaches 
        originate it could be from red-haired Susan. The wig department regularly 
        “harvests” her hair for just that purpose. Not only is Susan being austere 
        in <em>Don Carlos </em> at the moment but she is up all night taking care 
        of her ailing saluki dog, Wiley. Wiley came to Susan from an animal rescue 
        with a heart problem, and couldn't have landed in better care. Get well 
        soon, Wiley. </font></p>
