        a Week!</font></strong><font size="2"><br>
        <br>
        That hectic, thrilling life in the theater that is a Super&#8217;s midseason 
        dream came true this weekend with a veritable whirlpool of activity and 
        mixed metaphors. Your indefatigable correspondent, Ulrica, was there to 
        document it all.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Dateline: Friday, November the 5th</strong><br>
        <br>
        Things began Friday evening when 18 Supers and friends ventured outside 
        the City and County, over the Bay Bridge to nuclear-free Berkeley to attend 
        a performance of Noel Coward&#8217;s comedy <em>Present Laughter</em> 
        starring Super-turned-legit-actor <strong>Louis Schilling</strong>. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"><strong><img src="/funstuff/images/Ulrica11/8/louis-005.jpg" width="293" height="218"></strong></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Although 
        this London Blitz-era play isn&#8217;t one of Sir Noel&#8217;s better 
        known works(those would be <em>Private Lives</em> and <em>Blithe Spirit</em>), 
        it is nevertheless a very entertaining two hours of repartee and farcical 
        incidents in the life of eminent British thespian Garry Essendine (Louis) 
        who seemed to behave a lot like Sir Noel himself. Louis played the role 
        with perfect timing and exasperation, sounding a lot like Cary Grant and, 
        at times, a little like Austin Powers. He was very well-supported by fellow 
        members of the Actors Ensemble of Berkeley, with <strong>Melanie Curry</strong> 
        (as ex-wife Liz) and <strong>Maureen Coyne</strong> (as the long-suffering 
        secretary Monica) really standing out. The production values were great, 
        with authentic period costumes and a very handsome set dotted with framed 
        pics of Louis and his opera co-stars.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><img src="/funstuff/images/Ulrica11/8/louis-004.jpg" width="294" height="220"></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">We 
        were amazed at Louis&#8217; capacity for memorizing lines (something we 
        Supers of failing memory needn&#8217;t worry about) and his consistent 
        voice and sharp pace. A good time was had by all, before, during and after 
        the show. There are still a few more opportunities to see <em>Present 
        Laughter</em> before it closes on November the 20th and it&#8217;s only 
        ten bucks a ticket. Click <a href="http://www.aeofberkeley.org/" target="_blank">here</a> 
        if you're interested.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"> 
        Louis sent the following email:<br>
        <br>
        <font color="#000000"><em>Hey Everybody!<br>
        I can't tell you how honored I was that so many of you made it to my show; 
        it's one performance I'll never forget. It was so nice to see you all...I 
        feel that I've been away from the Opera for years. (FYI, I actually supered 
        this past summer in the Merola production of </em>The Rape of Lucretia<em> 
        at Fort Mason.) My castmates all told me that they, too, felt very special 
        when you applauded them as they exited the stage door. Thanks for that, 
        the flowers, the photos, your support and, most importantly, for being 
        there! Bravos to you all, <br>
        Louis</em></font><br>
        <br>
        <strong>Dateline: Saturday Afternoon</strong></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0;"><font size="2">Next 
        up was the &quot;Thank You&quot; reception lunch hosted by the dear folks 
        at the Opera Guild. Supers and Lightwalkers were out in force (to qualify 
        for an invite you have to have logged 10 volunteer hours, which can include 
        lightwalking but not supering. For more information on volunteering contact 
        <a href="mailto:cahluwalia@SFOpera.com">Cimi Ahluwalia</a>.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"><img src="/funstuff/images/Ulrica11/8/guildevent.jpg" width="284" height="188"></font></p>
      <p align="left" class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;"><font size="2"><font style="color:black;">The 
        reception was held in the lobby of the Opera House and among the speakers 
        was General Director <strong>Pamela Rosenberg</strong> noting that &#8220;the 
        doors of this opera house would not be open if it weren&#8217;t for all 
        you volunteers.&#8221;</font></font></p>
      <p align="left" class="spearhead" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"><font style="color:black;"><img src="/funstuff/images/Ulrica11/8/andrewatguild.jpg" width="285" height="189"> 
        <br>
        </font>The catering was first rate and hordes of hors d&#8217;oeuvres-hungry 
        Supers chowed down like starved socialites. <br>
        <br>
        <img src="/funstuff/images/Ulrica11/8/hungry.jpg" width="284" height="187"></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">The 
        final dress rehearsal of <em>Der Fliegende Hollander</em> followed the 
        reception. The production is exciting, graphic, and bold, and featured 
        some cool choreography by the chorus men and ballet ladies. The Dutchman&#8217;s 
        entrance and the spinning wheel scene were extraordinary. There was a 
        large audience with bus loads of seniors joining the Guild volunteers, 
        but future attendees be warned -- it is performed without intermission 
        (2 + hours), so go to the bathroom beforehand.<br>
        <br>
        The singing was uniformly excellent with the Senta, debuting Swedish soprano 
        <strong>Nina Stemme</strong>, a revelation to all (except Tom Carlisle 
        and Andrew Korniej who had seen her perform in an English-language <em>Manon 
        Lescaut</em> at London&#8217;s ENO a few years ago). IMHO,* we haven&#8217;t 
        seen a more graceful performer since <strong>Anna Caterina Antonacci</strong> 
        performed here (in <em>Norma</em>) six years ago, nor a more exciting 
        Dramatic Soprano since I can&#8217;t remember when.<br>
        <br>
        With <em>Le Grand Macabre</em> garnering rave reviews and <em>Dutchman</em> 
        opening this week it looks as though the season will go out with a bang, 
        albeit a Superless one. Speaking of which, it turns out a friend of the 
        production&#8217;s AD got the choice role of Lensky&#8217;s Second in 
        the new production of <em>Eugene Onegin</em>. Commiserations to the 15 
        guys who took the time to get to the Opera House from all points in the 
        Bay Area and stood around for an hour only to suffer wholesale rejection.<br>
        <br>
        But the casting for the Super Skit (premiering at the <a href="events/party2004/2004invite.html">Annual 
        Party</a> on Saturday, December 11th) promises to be much more egalitarian. 
        In a reversal of general Super casting procedures, if you want to be in 
        the show then a role will be found for you. Just let producer/director/author 
        <a href="/events/party2004/supercall.html">Charlie Lichtman</a> know and 
        be available for a few rehearsals (TBA).<br>
        <br>
        Also, Carrie received great news in the form of a very generous check 
        from Super <strong>Rudy Cook</strong>. Rudy wrote:<br>
        <br>
        <em>Dear fellow Supers: <br>
        All my good wishes to every one of you for your wonderful devotion to 
        Opera. Tho' my &quot;roles&quot; have been limited these past few years 
        I have always been with you in spirit.<br>
        Accept my contribution as more or less a subsidy for the upcoming Super 
        Party. My hope is to have the charge kept to a minimum.<br>
        All good wishes for a great season. My compliments to those responsible 
        for the latest edition of &quot;The Spearhead&quot; - by far the best 
        I have ever had the pleasure of receiving.<br>
        As ever,<br>
        Rudy Cook</em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Rudy, 
        On behalf of all the Supers, your contribution was much appreciated and 
        we&#8217;ll all look forward to an outstanding Super Party.</font></p>

        Sunday, November the 7th</strong><br>
        <br>
        Sunday was an important day in the history of SFO. When luminous Maestra 
        <strong>Sara Jobin</strong> wielded the baton for the Sunday matinee performance 
        of <em>Tosca</em> it was the first time that a woman had conducted a performance 
        on the main stage of the San Francisco Opera, during the main season. 
        <br>

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"> 
        It was a wonderful occasion and the company and audience were right there 
        with her. The performance rocked and it was particularly sweet to watch 
        the monitors and see her lip-synching the words as she went along: moving 
        from the soprano, through the tenor, to the baritone parts with alacrity. 
        Elton John would not have approved. <strong>Brava Sara!</strong></font></p>

        <br>
        <strong>Dateline: Wednesday, November the 10th</strong><br>
        <br>
        A good number of Supers, mostly <em>Tosca</em>-ninis, stayed up past their 
        usual bedtimes to attend the Company / Cast Party after the opening night 
        of <em>Der Fliegende Hollander,</em> filling three tables. Among the grateful 
        attendees were Committee Members <strong>Paul Szezcuil</strong> and the 
        lovely <strong>Irene Bechtel</strong>, Cardinal Jim Downey, <strong>Walt 
        Thorpe</strong> (surprisingly not wearing shorts), <strong>Steve Baumann</strong> 
        (surprisingly not wearing overalls) and veteran <strong>Paul Ricks</strong>. 
        Pamela Rosenberg graciously went around the room stopping at each table 
        to wish everyone &#8220;Guten Abend&#8221; and chatting for a few minutes. 
        <br>
        The center table was filled with the <em>Dutchman</em> cast and Pamela 
        made much of their rising star power, calling soprano Nina Stemme the 
        best Senta she has seen in 40 years worth of <em>Dutchman</em>s, and Finnish 
        bass-baritone <strong>Juha Uusitalo</strong> &#8220;the Wotan of the next 
        decade.&#8221; She also did the rounds of thanking each department: from 
        backstage to &#8220;the singers who represent us all.&#8221; <strong>Maestro 
        Runnicles</strong> then got up to thank Pamela and to say how he &#8220;can&#8217;t 
        conceive of the San Francisco Opera without her&#8221; after her scheduled 
        departure in the summer of 2006. He particularly emphasized her modesty 
        and how performances as great as that evening&#8217;s &#8220;are not great 
        just because all the artists happen to be here but because Pamela Rosenberg 
        brought them here.&#8221; You could appreciate their mutual affection 
        and the closeness of their partnership. As Maestro Runnicles said, modesty 
        is a quality not often found in the world of opera, and it would take 
        a European to appreciate this typically un-American virtue. He also thanked 
        his assistant, <strong>Maureen Mudge</strong>, for all her work; she leaves 
        for Australia on November the 19th.<br>
        <br>
        Some mention was made about a near-disaster the day of the dress rehearsal 
        when the scrim with the Dutchman&#8217;s shadow ripped. Ulrica had noticed 
        the obvious scar but thought it must represent the Dutchman&#8217;s recent 
        appendectomy. <br>
        <br>
        All the heartfelt tributes flying around were enough to distract even 
        Ulrica from her chicken and penne pasta and she enthusiastically joined 
        in the lengthy standing ovation for Pamela. She later got to congratulate 
        Miss Stemme, the evening&#8217;s outstanding star, who was very friendly 
        and very accessible.<br>
        <br>
        Finally, as the clock was approaching midnight Ulrica grabbed a last handful 
        of bite-sized desserts and wandered off into the wet evening, aglow with 
        the glamour of it all.</font></p>
