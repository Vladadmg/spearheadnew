        Roy Graddick (Kenn) </strong>was born November 30, 1949 in Detroit, Michigan 
        to Willie and Uletha Graddick and passed away peacefully in his sleep 
        November 10, 2005. As a child, he learned good values and integrity from 
        his family. He earned the rank of Eagle in the Boy Scouts of America Organization. 
        He was also a member of Junior Achievement of America, an organization 
        that teaches respect and excellence. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font color="#000000" size="2">In 
        1967, Kenn graduated from MacKenzie High School in Detroit and attended 
        Eastern Michigan University . The U.S. Army called Kenn to serve his country 
        in 1970. He was trained as a paratrooper with the 101 st Airborne Brigade 
        and served a tour of duty in Vietnam. He was honorably discharged in 1972 
        and returned to Michigan, where he resumed his employment with Bell Telephone. 
        In 1977, Kenn headed west to pursue a career in filmmaking. He enrolled 
        in the Berkeley Film School where he met his loving wife, Francee Covington.

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">I 
        only knew him for the run of <em>Italiana</em>, but instantly bonded to 
        him and his wise and pragmatic approach to our shared opera experience. 
        I was very impressed by his ability to study textbooks steadily one right 
        after another while we waited in our dressing room with the music and 
        stage calls whirling all around us, while my own single textbook sat forlornly 
        unstudied.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Kenn 
        was that rare person with whom I felt an instant and easy friendship, 
        who took what was apparently the many facets of a rich life in a confident, 
        calm stride. This was the Kenn Graddick I knew - may you rest in peace, 
        fellow freed Italian slave. And may courage and strength be with all of 
        you left behind - we will all miss him. - Tom Walsh</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">I 
        was just in the one opera (<em>Italiana</em>) with him and didn't get 
        a chance to spend too much time with Kenn but I found him to be a bright, 
        gentle and kind individual who seemed to care about the world around him. 
        He also seemed healthy and full of life so his sudden death comes as a 
        great surprise. It certainly teaches us to enjoy each day (and each show) 
      as though it were our last. I guess you just never know. - Ron Mann</font></p>
