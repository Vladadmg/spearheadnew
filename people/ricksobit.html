          &nbsp; </em><br>
          <br>
          <strong>Paul Ricks</strong>, whose career as a Super at the San Francisco 
          Opera covered over thirty seasons, is dead at the age of 74. Paul apparently 
          died over the weekend of October 8th, peacefully and of natural causes. 
          He is survived by family members in Florida and has been returned there 
          for interment.<br>
          <br>
          Paul began his Super career in 1969, most likely in the production of 
          <em>Aida</em> that year, and continued to super every year until his 
          final appearance, in <em>Tosca</em> in last year&#8217;s fall season, 
          making him one of the longest-serving active Supers with the company. 
          He was a favorite of director <strong>John Copley</strong> and was cast 
          in many of his productions, particularly in <em>Peter Grimes</em>, where 
          he was prominently featured as a tipsy doctor.<br>
          <br>
          Paul was originally from Chicago and worked as a nurse at the Army&#8217;s 
          Letterman Hospital in the Presido until its closure. After retirement 
          from the hospital, Paul worked at a number of part-time jobs, including 
          at Macy&#8217;s department store, and as a poll worker at elections.<br>
          <br>
          Never at a loss for words, Paul could talk to anyone on any subject, 
          at any time, and usually at great length. Toward this ability he never 
          stopped learning or studying to improve himself; he was a student with 
          A.C.T., took courses in using a computer and was an office volunteer 
          and Super with the San Francisco Ballet. He also took singing lessons 
          from <strong>Fred Winthrop</strong> of the SFO chorus.<br>
          <br>
          In addition to his 36 years with the San Francisco Opera, and frequent 
          appearances with the Ballet, Paul was an active Super with some of the 
          smaller opera companies in the city, including the old and new Lyric 
          Opera, and served on their Board of Directors. He was also involved 
          with the Russian Opera Company.<br>
          <br>
          A page of <a href="/people/peopleimages/ricksgallery/index.htm">photographs</a> 
          from Paul&#8217;s collection, including roles in some of opera&#8217;s 
          most familiar works, has been posted in his memory. It seems that he 
          had a particular fondness for ecclesiastical roles and for posing in 
          front of blue wardrobe crates. <br>
          <br>
          We will all miss Paul and can only hope that he has found a good listener 
          in St. Peter, if he can only stop talking long enough to pass through 
          the Pearly Gates.</font></p>

        <p style="margin-top: 0;"><strong><em>Remembrances</em></strong></p>
                <p>When I first met Paul backstage 
          sometime in the early 1990s, he had already evolved into his last look, 
          a perfect variation of the great English movie comedian Alistair Sims. 
          (Thanks for the picture gallery, by the way, where you can see the evolution.) 
          At first, I thought he was a crank and a bit crazy, and it took me a 
          couple of years running into him in the neighborhood to realize he was 
          quite bright, knew his classical music, and was not really crazy at 
          all. He was also a seriously kind soul and I grew to love him.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> At the audition this year 
          for super parts, he was one of the dozen characters who stepped forward 
          to try out for the &quot;Vlad the Impaler&quot; role, charging forward 
          with a yell that was so perfectly hilarious that the crowd did the right 
          thing and burst into applause. I'll miss him backstage terribly, although 
          if there is such a thing as spirits hanging around this earth, Paul 
          will definitely be around the opera house basement for a while.<br>
          <br>

        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Paul volunteered every week 
          in the San Francisco Ballet School office, where I got to know him over 
          the last 5&frac12; years. He and I talked extensively about movies, 
          literature, journalism, and the differences between our generations 
          (there was a 40-year age gap). He had a bawdy sense of humor and a keen 
          sense of observation. His stories about being backstage at the SF Opera 
          over a 30-year period were priceless and an amusing finale to what were 
          usually very long weeks. He kept the SFBS office well supplied with 
          candy of all kinds, much to the chagrin of some of the ballet teachers. 
          We often had lunch together and I looked forward to his observations, 
          from <em>New Yorker</em> articles to the latest bad &quot;reality show&quot; 
          on TV. <br>
          <br>
          When I left the ballet in July, we promised to stay in touch and we 
          did have lunch a couple of times. The Ballet will miss him as much as 
          the Opera, as a great reliable and dedicated volunteer, I am sure, but 
          I will miss him as one of my wisest and most fascinating friends.<br>
