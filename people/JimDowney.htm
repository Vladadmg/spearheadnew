        1934 - 2005 </h4>
      <p align="left">Long-time Super 
        <strong>Jim Downey</strong> passed away on January 27, 2005. </p>
      <p>Born in Michigan in 1934, <img src="peopleimages/Doncarlos2.jpg" width="240" height="160" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="left">Jim 
        was an investment counselor by trade, and his hobbies included the martial 
        arts (a 2nd degree black belt in Judo), being a pilot, and, of course, 
        Supering, where he will be remembered, among a host of other (often clergical) 
        roles, for being chosen to be the Cardinal in the &quot;Te Deum&quot; 
        parade in the 75th season gala re-opening <em>Tosca</em>. He was divorced, 
        but remained close to his former wife and their four children. He will 
        be very much missed.</p>
      <p>In lieu of flowers, his family 
        has asked that donations be made to the Super Committee in his name. Send 
        checks made out to &quot;Super Committee&quot; to: Paul Newman, 244 Kearny 
        St., San Francisco, CA 94108. </p>
      <p>A memorial service was held 
        on Monday, January 31, 2005 in Fort Jones, California. Please feel free 
        to contribute to the &quot;Memories&quot; section, below.</p>

      <p> I first met Jim during rehearsals 
        for <em>Giulio Cesare </em>in the summer of 2002, worked with him in many 
        productions that followed. Jim was always there with a quiet smile, a 
        funny story, and kind word. I last saw Jim at the Lamplighter&#8217;s 
        <em>Yeoman of the Guard</em> performance on January 22. It was a great 
        shock to hear of his death on January 27. I am among many who will miss 
        his presence. ~ Paul Szczesiul</p>
      <p>In the last <em>Don Carlos</em>, 
        I was a prison guard in the third act, and Jim's role was as an &quot;evil 
        monk&quot; who would enter and whisper conspiratorally in my ear, after 
        which I would depart, allowing for the murder of Rodrigo. Of course, being 
        Jim, he always whispered an off-color joke in my ear. Fortunately, my 
        back was to the audience so my chuckles were not visible. ~ Mark Burstein</p>
      <p>Jim was a warm presence with 
        a subtle, sly smile and kindness oozed from his eyes. As the Pope<em></em>&#8212;or 
        whatever he was&#8212;in <em>Tosca,</em> he let me kiss his ring and follow 
        him around. He seemed amused by almost everything, and I get the feeling 
        he had a lot more to say than he did. He was a gentleman. We didn't really 
        know each other, but he paid attention to me as if I were a trusted friend 
        and he laughed openly at my dumb jokes. With his perfect posture and presidential 
        demeanor, he made us all proud to be a Super alongside him. May God bless 
        him on his journey. With a reluctant heart I say Good Bye. ~ John Guglielmelli</p>
      <p>Jim befriended me during the 
        1996 <em>Aida</em> and in the years to follow, he always greeted me with 
        a genuine smile and a new repertoire of raunchy jokes. Jim was a true 
        gentleman who loved opera, appreciated beautiful women, and had a boundless 
        sense of humor. It looks like <em>Tosca</em> will have to be in permanent 
        hiatus now that Jim is no longer with us. ~ Mike Harvey</p>
      <p>It is a profound shock to me 
        that Jim has died. As another of the &quot;Keystone Monks&quot; during 
        <em>Don Carlos</em> I had the privilege of spending a lot of time with 
        him, enjoying his wry wit. Because we shared careers in the stock market, 
        there was always something to talk over. Happy Trails, Jim, I'll miss 
        you. ~ Al Cummings</p>
      <div>A couple of seasons ago I had missed Comp Night for the <em>Cav/Pag</em> 
        double bill so I went a few nights later without, shall we say, a seat 
        assignment. I bumped into Jim in the orchestra section and it turned out 
        he was in the same situation. He had the scoop on where the best seat 
        was to see the one and only Super performance&nbsp;of the entire evening. 
        Like two mischievous schoolboys, we managed to sneak around under the 
        noses of&nbsp;the hawkish ushers and slip into vacant seats&nbsp;to get 
        a good view of Tom Carlisle on stage right. The last time I saw Jim was 
        when he was&nbsp;about to go on&nbsp;at the last performance of <em>Tosca</em>. 
        He would always stand in the exact same spot in his heavy robes looking 
        as though he was waiting for someone to wheel him onstage for the &quot;Te 
        Deum&quot; a la Fellini's <em>Roma</em>. Seeing the photos on this site, 
        especially the one with Carol Vaness, reminds me what a sweet and funny 
        man he was.~ Andrew Korniej </div>
      <p> I was saddened to hear of Jim's 
        passing. Although I didn't know him well, I remember one amusing conversation 
        we had during our last <em>Tosca</em> run.&nbsp; He was holding forth 
        with some very strong views about the Catholic Church while in the middle 
        of putting on his bejewelled costume to play the Cardinal. (No one wore 
        red and gold brocade better than he did!)&nbsp; I loved the irony of that 
        moment.&nbsp;There was obviously much wit and intelligence behind his 
        stately presence, and he will be greatly missed.&nbsp; ~ Grove Wiley </p>
      <div>I was distressed to hear of Jim's passing. He was a thorough delight 
        in every way during my stint as Super Captain. I could always rely on 
        him to come for last-minute rehearsals and lightwalking gigs. He was jovial, 
        never complained and glad to do it. A real trouper in every sense of the 
        word, and a lovely man. He was one of the joys of my era. ~ Todd Calvin</div>
      <p>Jim was an immeasurable asset 
        to the Super and lightwalking rosters. As a Super he was a regal and graceful 
        bishop (the only production he's been in during my tenure), and as a lightwalker 
        he was eager and contributive. He always had a nice word for people. Right 
        after I became Super Coordinator, my email relationship began with Jim. 
        He took a liking to my name right away&#8212;he would always call me &quot;Irish.&quot; 
        (Mr. Downey was also of Irish decent.) Sometimes I would get emails that 
        said nothing but, &quot;Good morning, Irish.&quot; It was such an immediate 
        endearment. I will remember Jim fondly. ~ Carrie Murphy</p>
      <div>Thank you all so much for your kind words and thoughts about Dad. It 
        touches us deeply. Of course, we are all in a little bit of shock still.&nbsp; 
        The opera held such a special place in his heart for so many years.&nbsp; 
        ~ Colleen Downey-Moran </div>
