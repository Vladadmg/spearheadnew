      <p align="center" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong><font size="4"><span style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><img src="peopleimages/images/JPortrait.jpg" width="200" height="210" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="left"></span>Jan Padover</font></strong></p>
      <p style="margin-top:0;">You&rsquo;ve undoubtedly seen him in the canteen, sketching away  furiously, as you pass by during a scene change or the end of your onstage <em>shtick</em>. Or perhaps he&rsquo;s given you a warm  greeting and a lift in one of the lobby elevators as you ascended into your  seat in the Heavens (or the Balcony as it&rsquo;s known around here). Or perhaps  you&rsquo;ve enjoyed his comic book, <em>An Opera  Comic</em>, or his <em>La Boh&egrave;me Advent  Calendar</em>. But I am getting ahead of the story&hellip;</p>
      <p>Behind the genial personality is a  musician and an artist of rare talent and range, whose devotion to the San  Francisco Opera began well over thirty years ago when his father, who served as  a stationary engineer at the War Memorial (lighting, mechanics, A/C, plumbing)  from 1966 to 1981, would invite his young son in for a peek at what was  happening both on- and backstage.</p>
      <p>Jan (pronounced &ldquo;Yahn&rdquo;) was born  and grew up in San Francisco, in what he describes as &ldquo;the artistic community of  Portrero Hill in the &rsquo;60s.&rdquo; He next lived in Sweden for seven years, where he studied  art (a small language problem enrolled him in graphic design when he thought  he would be studying fine art etching). Shortly after he returned, his father  happened to hear that the House needed an elevator operator for <em>Nutcracker</em>, which Jan thought would be  a good gig for about a week, but has turned out to be his &ldquo;day job&rdquo; and studio for twenty-five  years.</p>
      <p><img src="peopleimages/images/JPainting.jpg" width="365" height="245" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="right">To this day, Jan is a classical oil  painter, particularly in the Romantic &ldquo;Orientalist&rdquo; tradition (think Delacroix,  Dulac, G&eacute;r&ocirc;me, Ingres) and occasionally teaches art in high schools. He finds  himself drawn to depicting the cultures of North Africa and the Middle East, where  he has traveled and is also actively involved in those cultures as a  percussionist, often playing for the Palestinian, Jewish, and Assyrian communities  in the Bay Area. (His main axe is a drum called the <em>dumbeck</em>.)</p>

<p><img src="peopleimages/images/JPAdvent.jpg" width="412" height="237" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="left">Jan&rsquo;s advent calendar, a  three-dimensional work portraying both historical and contemporary Opera stars  behind the windows of <em>Boh&egrave;me</em>&rsquo;s Act II  (set on Christmas Eve), came out in 1984 and has just recently sold out.</p>
<p>Jan had an epiphany of sorts one  day in the elevator after he had been standing in the back of the House listening  to an audience member loudly unwrapping candy and chattering away during a performance  and, understandably, imagined the singers wanting to murder her. Instead, he channeled this fantasy  into <em>An Opera Comic</em>, a witty,  engaging Gilbert &amp; Sullivan&ndash;esque parody of the types inhabiting the stage  and the pit, and addressed to misbehaving audience <a href="peopleimages/images/JPP.pdf"><img src="http://spearheadnews.com/people/peopleimages/images/JPComic200.jpg" width="200" height="311" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="right"></a>members. Divas, tenors,  conductors, choristers, and Supers have their turn in the spotlight, but &ldquo;as  each chapter had to outdo the previous one, I put Supers last, the best of  all.&rdquo; However, he&rsquo;s a bit worried we will &ldquo;come after him,&rdquo; as he captured our  foibles so brilliantly, having so often observed and overheard us in the  canteen. (Click on the cover at right for some sample pages.) </p>
      <p>Jan also has several fine decks of  playing cards for sale on his <a href="http://www.prosperoart.com" target="_blank">Prospero Art</a> Web site: <em>Shakespeare  Quotes</em>, <em>Shakespeare Insults</em>, <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, and <em>The Rat Pack</em>, the last named due to his  business partner, <a href="http://www.sinatra.bz/" target="_blank">Rick Ellis</a>, who is a Sinatra impersonator by  trade. In fact, they are currently collaborating on a Sinatra/Shakespeare  musical, <em>Chairman of the Bard</em>, to be  sung in fluent 1930s Brooklynese and intended, at least for now, as a CD and  comic book. Jan is also currently at work on a set of <em>Nutcracker</em> playing cards. Many of his paintings are available as notecards. </p>
      <p>Of course, aside from a free  &ldquo;studio&rdquo; and income, Jan&rsquo;s job allows him to spend his evenings in the presence  of grand opera. He believes that &ldquo;Great opera <em>anyone</em> would love, but many people only get exposed to mediocre opera. Opera  has the most problematic chemistry in all the arts, only as strong as its weakest  link, which could be stage direction, singing, whatever.&rdquo; But when asked which  ones have &ldquo;rocked his world,&rdquo; Jan named the Gavanelli <em>Rigoletto</em> (2006)&mdash;&ldquo;it so surprised me I dropped my drawing and went  into the house every night&rdquo;; the 2000 <em>Parsifal</em> memorable for its futuristic, intergalactic staging (&ldquo;I came out humming the  lighting,&rdquo; he remarks); &rdquo; and Domingo&rsquo;s 1987 <em>Hoffman</em> with its Tiepelo-inspired stage design. Of late he has  become enamored of H&auml;ndel, as personified in Swenson&rsquo;s <em>Semele</em> (2000) and the &ldquo;Mafia-inspired&rdquo; <em>Alcina</em> of 2002.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">No reader of the <em>Spearhead</em> should be without <em>The Opera Comic</em>. Please <a href="http://www.janpadover.com/" target="_blank">visit his Web  site</a> and do say &ldquo;hi&rdquo; when you see him, if for no other reason than to show  we&rsquo;re not really &ldquo;coming after him.&rdquo;</p>
