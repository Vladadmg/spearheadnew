        <p align="left" class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"> 
          A few weeks ago Ulrica emerged from her usual Winter Hibernation to 
          a new Opera Administration and a Soprano <em>G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung</em>. 
          Having recently celebrated a half century of loveliness, she opened 
          up a copy of <a href="/funstuff/images/Ulrica4_2005/NYTimesarticle.html" target="_blank">The 
          New York Times</a> to read about what had been going on in the world 
          whilst she caught her much-needed beauty sleep. She smiled superciliously 
          at the headline &#8220;Justices Remove Hurdle to Suits Alleging Age 
          Bias.&#8221; &#8220;Old as I am,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;the world 
          of the performing Super is still at my feet. No one would dare to age-discriminate 
          against this old hag now.&#8221;<br>
          <br>
          Her confidence was shattered a few minutes later when she perused her 
          email and came across the startling bulletin listing <a href="/Auditions2.html" target="_blank">Super 
          ops</a> for the coming seasons. Being as old as the sum of the age parameters, 
          she feared that there was no hope for her continued presence on the 
          operatic stage and immediately flew to her telephone to contact her 
          attorney. </font></p>
        <p align="left" class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"><img src="/funstuff/images/Ulrica4_2005/AARPcard.jpg" width="297" height="183"><br>
          Could this be a cruel joke, a bad dream, another of those drama-turgid 
          directorial conceits, or are middle-aged men the new Super Women?<br>
          <br>
          Age-specific nonsense invites the question &#8220;Why do we have wigs 
          and makeup?&#8221; And since when has this most fanciful of performing 
          arts cared that its participants be the person he or she is playing? 
          We have, after all, seen African-American geishas, 300-pound Chinese 
          princesses, midwestern Ethiopians, and senile Salomes, so why not deliver 
          over-30-year-old military men and pearl-fishing Ceylonese in good makeup 
          and hair dye? (Although, as <strong>Paul Szczesiul</strong> remarked, 
          &#8220;We would have to stop eating now to fit into those <a href="http://spearheadnews.com/images/pearlfishercostume.html" target="_blank">costumes</a>.&#8221;) 
          After all, Simon Elliott-LeBohn can do only so much. &#8230;<br>
          <br>
          And besides, isn&#8217;t it a theatrical rule of thumb that things are 
          designed to look good from a distance? One hopes so, because some of 
          those sets look pretty grim from close quarters. So given that, who 
          in the Grand Tier and beyond can see our wrinkles and gray hairs? Certainly 
          the old codgers dozing off in the first three rows (and we&#8217;ve 
          all seen them) couldn&#8217;t care less about the age of those dim, 
          dark figures at the back of the stage.<br>
          <br>
          Anyhow, the <em>Pearl Fishers</em> <a href="Auditions2.html">audition</a> 
          is on May 10, and Ulrica, although in her dotage, will be there, undaunted,
           and hopes some other seniors will make it too. And, hey, how about
          casting 
          some women <em>en travesti</em> in young male roles? Of course, it
          wouldn&#8217;t 
          be the first time we&#8217;ve seen operatic gender confusion. Not to
          belabor the point, but will all the choristers in these productions
          be under thirty? I think not. I do think, however, that most twenty-somethings
          won&#8217;t want to work all summer for a mere 125 bucks.<br>
          <br>
          Meanwhile,
          getting into character for the audition, <strong>Mike Harvey</strong>          was
          out fishing for pearls and this is what he found:<br>

          Speaking of good wigs and makeup, beloved Honorary Super <strong>Denise 
          Gutierrez</strong> will have the scoop on Super ops for the excellent 
          <a href="http://www.festivalopera.com/" target="_blank">Festival Opera</a> 
          in Walnut Creek and promises to share it with us soon. Festival O is 
          doing <em>Un Ballo in Maschera</em> and <em>Candide</em> this summer. 
          I haven&#8217;t heard of any Super age restrictions attached, but the 
          masks at the ball should hide most of our wrinkles. <br>
          <br>
          Gorgeous <strong>Hope Briggs</strong>, the under-utilized soprano from 
          last year&#8217;s <em>Doktor Faust</em>, will star as the <em>Ballo</em> 
          Amelia and should be fabulous. A Super contingent will be there with 
          bouquets, led by this correspondent, anxious to see her <em>Act 1:Scene 
          2</em> namesake.<br>
          <br>
          Speaking of bouquets, several designed by the lovely florist Laurel 
          Winzler were featured on the front page of the <em>SF Chronicle</em> 
          a few months ago. The occasion was MTT&#8217;s sixtieth Birthday Bash 
          (I hope he doesn&#8217;t have any aspirations to be an SFO Super), and 
          Laurel used yards of ribbon to to embellish the presentation bouquets 
          for the maestro and his stars, including Thomas Hampson and Audra McDonald. 
          As Laurel remarked, &#8220;If you can&#8217;t make it onto the front 
          page yourself, at least get your work on it.&#8221;</font></p>

            headed to New York with her loved one and with fellow Super <strong>Charlie

          and <strong>Jeanne-Claude</strong>&#8217;s newest creation, <a href="http://www.christojeanneclaude.net/tg.html#statement" target="_blank">The

          work of art was truly an awe-inspiring sight: each gate was a proscenium, 
          each an opportunity for a curtain call. New Yorkers rose to the occasion, 
          and even mink-clad Park Avenue matrons were giddy with the excitement 
          of it all.<br>

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Opera 
        was at a premium, with the NYCO on hiatus and the Met serving up an unremarkable 
        series of greatest hits. However, our merry band managed to catch their 
        Super-intensive <strong>Zefferelli</strong> production of <em>Turandot</em> 
        (never have so many <em>popoli</em> been seen, for so long, and from so far away). 
        But the real discovery was a small company, <a href="http://www.gothamchamberopera.org/" target="_blank">Gotham
        Chamber Opera</a>, whose 
        U.S.-premiere production of Handel&#8217;s <em>Arianna in Creta.</em><br>
        <br>
        Proving that it really is a tiny world, the three of us took our seats 
        in the small theater and found ourselves sitting right next to Hammy Award-winning 
        Super and lightwalker <strong>Ursula Grunfeld</strong>! Ursula was there 
        to support her Adler Fellow sponsoree <strong>Katherine Rohrer</strong>, 
        who was outstanding in the challenging role of Teseo. The cast was universally 
        excellent, and director <strong>Christopher Alden</strong> gave us some 
        unforgettable imagery, not least of which was Kat singing one very difficult 
        passage while actually brushing her teeth. The production was New York&#8217;s 
      operatic event of the month, and deservedly so.</font><font size="2"><br>
        <img src="/funstuff/images/Ulrica4_2005/ariadne.jpg" width="251" height="462" vspace="4"><br>
        Christopher Alden is an extraordinary director, although his recent Opera 
        Center triple bill (<em>What Fools These Husbands Be!</em>) at the Cowell
        Theater didn&#8217;t strike Ulrica as being quite as well resolved. Perhaps
        the time constraints of a one-act work fight against the overall development
        of an image. It was sold out, though, and definitely had its moments.
        The SFO Royalty were out in force on Opening Night with OC Director <strong>Sherri 
        Greenawald</strong> applauding ferociously and the usual Super supects 
        hanging out in the foyer, as only Supers can.<br>
        <br>
        Katherine Rohrer returns to SFO for a handful of performances in <em>Cosi 
        fan Tutte </em>and will be the subject of an interview by <strong>Tom 
        Carlisle</strong>. I&#8217;m told that <strong>Nathan Gunn</strong> will 
        also be making a very welcome return in <em>Cosi</em>. If SFO knows anything 
        about its audience, it will provide him with the opportunity to bare his 
        chest. But the <em>Cosi</em> highlight will, of course, be getting another 
        chance to see Super redhead and <em>Spearhead</em> team member <strong>Lynn 
      Meinhardt</strong> looking hot in her WWI nurse&#8217;s uniform.</font></p>

        My sources tell me that Supers at the Houston Grand Opera get much better
        reimbursement for <img src="/funstuff/images/Ulrica4_2005/einstein.jpg" width="120" height="110" align="right">their efforts than do we. One would push for a pay
        raise
        if there were any work for One. As things stand, it&#8217;s a moot point,
        unless the directors happen to be looking for Albert Einstein look-alike
        mad scientists for the atomic bomb opera.</font></p>

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"> 
        And what happened to <em>La Fanciulla Del West</em>? Can it be true that 
        it was dropped from the season so late in the day that they had to reprint 
        the brochure? Shame on them for not making it happen (despite being set 
        in Northern California, and despite being one of Puccini&#8217;s most 
        exciting operas, it hasn&#8217;t been performed at SFO in over 20 years). 
        <em>NY Times</em> critic <strong>Anne Midgette</strong> reviewed the new 
        Glimmerglass/NYCO production and praised its &#8220;wonderful, rich, dense 
        score.&#8221; But if a substitute was required, did it have to be <em>Madama 
        Butterfly</em> for (I think) the sixth time in a dozen seasons? Don&#8217;t 
        they realize that <strong>Oliver Pollard</strong> left town?<br>
        <br>
        And as for that Soprano <em>G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung</em>, we should 
        mourn the recent passings of <strong>Victoria de los Angeles</strong> 
        and <strong>Renata Tebaldi</strong>; true artists, both. Although I never 
        had the opportunity to see Tebaldi perform, one of my most cherished operatic 
        memories is of Victoria de los Angeles singing a recital, as a last-minute 
        substitution for <strong>Caballe</strong>, at Davies Symphony Hall about 
        ten years ago. It was a truly magical evening.<br>
        <br>
        As these things happen in threes (<strong>Pope John Paul II</strong>, 
        <strong>Prince Rainier III</strong> and <strong>Terri Schiavo</strong>, 
        for example), if I were <strong>Licia Albanese</strong>, I would be very 
        worried.</font></p>

        - Yesterday's mail brought my copy of the new 2005-2006 SFO season brochure. 
        Ulrica understands that opera is really all about sex but did&nbsp;it 
        have to be so ..er... Sapphic? <em>La Forza</em> may have a heroine in 
        drag but it is really about the love between two men who are, unknowingly, 
        enemies. Odd to see Joan of Arc depicted as one of the Dykes on Bikes, 
        but it is interesting to note, given recent dictates, that the only lady 
        of &quot;a certain age&quot; shown in the brochure is behind bars!</font></p>
