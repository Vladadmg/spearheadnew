        Tom Reed, Chorus</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Verdi's 
        <em>La Traviata</em> is among the loveliest of operas, and as someone 
        lucky enough to be a member of the chorus in San Francisco Opera's resplendent 
        production, I can tell you firsthand that everyone on stage had the most 
        extraordinary time. This opera is filled with the kind of happy, big-crowd 
        choruses that audiences adore! Dressed in sumptuous costumes we pack the 
        stage with elegant festivity. The opulent set employs “forced perspective,” 
        which is to say that in order to make the set appear larger, it actually 
        grows narrower as one moves upstage, creating the illusion of depth and 
        space. Now as we know, the upstage area is the realm of the chorus, and 
        I can confide that things do tend to get just a bit tight up there. Compressing 
        forty-four choristers, half of them in six-foot-wide <em>Gone With The 
        Wind</em> hoopskirts, into an ever narrowing space requires perhaps a 
        wee bit more force than perspective. But we manage it with astonishing 
        grace and poise. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">The 
        curtain rose Tuesday night on a festive party bubbling with guests and 
        courtesans. Some of us are lucky enough to be placed all the way down 
        front where we get to exchange an hilarious anecdote with none other than 
        Violetta, the principal soprano! But almost immediately we must move upstage 
        to our positions for the famous “<em>Libiamo</em>” chorus. Now, the trek 
        from my downstage left “laughing” position to my upstage right “drinking” 
        position can be fraught with peril. Everyone moves at once. There's a 
        lot for us to do, and it must all be accomplished in less than twenty 
        seconds. There can be no train wrecks! For me it requires dodging principals, 
        weaving through a boiling sea of moving furniture and guests, and avoiding 
        at all cost the greatest faux pas of all — treading on those hoops. You 
        can understand why the entire move had to be carefully choreographed and 
        rehearsed. Yet last night it went off without a hitch! </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Well...., 
        we all expand just a little on opening night, taking up ever so slightly 
        more space than we required in rehearsals. So just before the big move 
        I nervously glanced upstage to survey the field of battle. To my horror, 
        all was not as expected. I was supposed to pass between two chorus women, 
        but forces beyond their control had shoved them tightly together. There 
        they stood, practically joined at the hip, their hoopskirts bowing outward 
        in opposite directions like a set of Siamese church bells. In one terrifying 
        flash I realized that there would be no room for them to move apart, and 
        no way for me to get around them. I was going to have to bowl my way right 
        through them! At that same instant their eyes locked onto me like laser 
        weapons that had found their target. Something in their fixed smiles seemed 
        to say, “Try it and die!!” </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">There 
        was no time to think. On cue the whole stage sprang into action. Choristers 
        moved in all directions, supernumerary servants grabbed furniture and 
        plowed into the fray, principals scrambled for the safety of downstage, 
        and the fateful moment had arrived. With trepidation I pushed myself upstage 
        toward my appointment with destiny. But just as I approached the blockade 
        a miracle happened! </font><font size="2"> </font></p>

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Out 
        of somewhere a chorus gentleman squeezed forward to kiss the hand of the 
        lady on the left, distracting her just long enough for me to pounce. In 
        a move not unlike Quasimodo leaping onto the bells, I hopped onto the 
        left hoopskirt while simultaneously swinging the other one up and away 
        with my free foot. With a polite “Pardon me,” I then jammed myself between 
        the two and forced my way through to the other side. Before the two women 
        could react I made my getaway by hopping in behind a couple of supers 
        who were valiantly fighting their way across the stage using a table as 
        a battering ram. Riding its wake through the raging choral waters I was 
        able to reach my destination on the far upstage right shore, where my 
        assigned lady companions waited nervously. Pretending to kiss the hand 
        of one, I deftly yanked her out of the way of a moving chair, wedged her 
        into a corner, stuffed the other one onto an overcrowded sofa, and grabbed 
        a glass of fake champagne just in time to join in the sparkling toast 
        to love! </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Throughout 
        the scene the chorus kept up the jovial mood until Violetta nearly ruined 
        it with her repeated fainting spells. Just as the chorus was heading upstage 
        to dance we had to keep stopping and looking back to see what was wrong 
        with her. And we had to pull these mass maneuvers off without looking 
        like a giant accordion. Think it's easy? Try it yourself at your next 
        hoopskirt party. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">In 
        the next act the plot turned morose, so we worked feverishly to restore 
        the festive mood by faking a bull fight — no small accomplishment in tuxes 
        and hoops — but once again a principal came in and ruined everything. 
        This time it was Alfredo kicking up a ruckus downstage. We rushed forward, 
        falling all over ourselves to hear what was going on, only to witness 
        the ill-tempered Alfredo throwing a pile of cash in Violetta's face. It's 
        always the principals! </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">From 
        there on it was all downhill. In the last act we tried one last time to 
        brighten things by whooping it up offstage as a bunch of drunken revelers, 
        but meanwhile onstage some doctor was telling everyone that Violetta had 
        only a few hours left to live. Honestly, how can a chorus compete with 
        that much negative energy? We gave up and went home. And Violetta? She 
        didn't even last six minutes. Another downer! Sorry. We really tried.
