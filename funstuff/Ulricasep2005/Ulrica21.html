        Saturday night&#8217;s Opera opening nominal star was Juno-esque <strong>Olga 
        Borodina</strong> as an Italian girl stranded in Algiers;<img src="/funstuff/Ulricasep2005/menalgiers.jpg" width="225" height="150" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="left">however, 
        all Super binoculars were trained on Supers <strong>Ron Mann</strong> 
        (in practically every scene as Vlad the Impaler)<img src="/funstuff/Ulricasep2005/womenalgiers.jpg" width="225" height="150" align="right">, 
        vivacious <strong>Kimberly Thompson</strong>, and beautiful Brazilian 
        newcomer <strong>Paula Andrea Tomazini</strong> as the harem slaves. They 
        even got their own curtain call. Paula read about supering on the Internet, 
        came to the &quot;<a href="../cattlecall.html">Bovine Review</a>&quot; 
        and landed this plum role. Veteran Supers were quick to point out that 
        supering isn&#8217;t always that plum. Honorable onstage mention should 
        also be made of Supers <strong>Eddy Gordillo</strong>, <strong>Kenn Graddick</strong>, 
        and <strong>Tom Walsh</strong>, who skillfully maneuvered aviatrix Olga 
        into and out of the hot air balloon that wittily spirits her away at the 
        end of the opera.<br>
        <br>
        In the audience that night were glamour girls <strong>Laurel Winzler</strong> 
        and <strong>Irene Bechtel</strong>, who was draped in white maribou. Laurel, 
        sporting a French Twist <em>a la</em> <strong>Kim Novak</strong>, was 
        spotted in the horseshoe post-opera, engaging the phenomenally handsome 
        mayor of San Francisco, <strong>Gavin Newsom</strong>, in conversation. 
        Apparently they know each other from his pre-politico days. Gavin was 
        overheard telling Laurel how beautiful City Hall looked that night. Kimberly 
        Thompson was a sensation in her Violetta Valery black taffeta and tuille 
        gown &#8211; a souvenir from the <a href="../../events/salethanks.html">Costume 
        Shop sale</a> back in July.*<br>
        <br>
        Opening Night <img src="/funstuff/Ulricasep2005/polandpreswife.jpg" width="225" height="157" align="left">announcements 
        were unfortunately marred by a diplomatic gaffe; the Opera Chairman forgot 
        the name of the visiting president of Poland (<strong>Aleksander Kwasniewski</strong>) 
        and his wife, <strong>Jolanta</strong>, who had been seated in one of 
        the less prominent boxes. The giggles from the audience were presumably 
        caused by embarrassment at the <strong>George W. Bush</strong>-ism of 
        it all. An international incident was avoided, however, by Maestro <strong>Donald 
        Runnicles</strong>&#8217; stirring rendition of the Polish National Anthem, 
        preceding the &quot;Star Spangled Banner.&quot; Of lesser note was Maestro&#8217;s 
        rendition of the overture to <em>L&#8217;Italiana in Algeri</em>, which 
        sounded less like Rossini and more like Gluck to this listener. <br>
        <br>
        <img src="/funstuff/Ulricasep2005/paulcharlie.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="right">Suffering 
        from a glamour hangover, Ulrica dragged herself to <a href="../../events/2005operainpark/parkintro.html">Opera 
        in the Park</a> on Sunday. Dashing <strong>David Daniels</strong> was 
        the star of the show and was seen hanging out and eating pizza at the 
        Super campsite with <em>Rodelinda</em> co-star <strong>Paul Szczesiul</strong>. 
        Sadly La Borodina declined to participate in the event, obviously forgetting 
        that she had made her American debut at the 1991 Opera in the Park when 
        she was in town, although not singing, with the Russian <em><a href="../../W&Particle.html">War 
        and Peace</a></em> contingent that season.<br>
        <br>
        The program was delightfully full of Adler Fellows, and almost the entire 
        cast of top secret <em>Dr. Atomic</em>. Outgoing General Director <strong>Pamela 
        Rosenberg</strong> inadvertently brought extra humor to the proceedings, 
        encouraging the audience to &#8220;fill out their rifle tickets&#8221; 
        and to take advantage of the &quot;fifteen cent discount on ticket prices.&#8221; 
        She introduced David Daniels as &#8220;not just another countertenor&#8221; 
        and then, cringingly, managed to confuse &#8220;another countertenor&#8221; 
        Adler Fellow <strong>Gerald Thompson</strong> with Dr. Atomic himself, 

        <strong>Gerald Finley</strong>. Oh well. We&#8217;ll miss her when she&#8217;s 
        gone!<img src="/funstuff/Ulricasep2005/Panorama-2005.jpg" width="600" height="143" vspace="4"><br>
        Actually we will. She has brought some incredible moments to the War Memorial 
        stage, and her legacy of <em>St. Francois</em> <em>d&#8217;Assisse</em> 
        and, no doubt, <em>Dr Atomic</em>, will assure her place in SFO history 
        in much the same way as Terence McEwen's staging of <em>Don Carlos</em> 
        in 1986 and his magnificent <em>Ring Cycle</em>, and Lotfi Mansouri's 
        <em>War and Peace</em> and <em>Dead Man Walking </em>did for them. Pamela 
        has a new job as Intendant (administrative director) of the <a href="http://www.berliner-philharmoniker.de/" target="_blank">Berlin 
        Philharmonic</a>, which probably means all those fedoras will be going 
        into deep storage.<br>
        <br>
        And, just for the record, let me say that I think we Supers have been 
        very well treated under Pamela&#8217;s leadership, especially in terms 
        of complimentary tickets and other perks, such as invitations to the cast 
        parties (albeit a short-lived bonus). Remember when we couldn&#8217;t 
        even rely on bringing a guest to Final Dress?<br>
        <br>
        <img src="/funstuff/Ulricasep2005/oak.jpg" width="178" height="289" align="right">I&#8217;m 
        told that Pamela will be supering in the upcoming <em>Flute for Kids</em> 
        performances, appearing as a tree. Some may say she was born to play the 
        part, but Ulrica is more interested in the strange connections between 
        General Managers and Supers. Lotfi began his operatic career carrying 
        spears and Pamela is ending hers (for now, at least) as one of us. What 
        is the great significance of all this?<br>
        <br>
        I heard that Pamela hasn&#8217;t been attending all the rehearsals. My 
        informant hopes that the Production Super Captain will take her aside 
        and explain to her the importance of being on time for all calls. And 
        remember, Pamela, no eating in costume!<br>
        <br>
        Currently installed in the Opera House lobby is an extensive black and 
        white photo-documentation of the entire SF Opera Orchestra taken by our 
        very own Two-Time Hammy Award Winner, <strong>John F. (Digital) Martin</strong>. 
        It was hard to get close to it because of the crowds and the gowns on 
        Opening Night but it&#8217;s an impressive display. Be sure to check it 
        out. John took the photos in the House and at his studio in San Rafael, 
        and should be documenting the chorus and dancers next. <br>

        In more Laurel news, that Twisted Sister recently celebrated her fiftieth 
        Birthday, along with veteran Supes <strong>Carolyn </strong>(Sally Jo 
        LaRue)<strong> Waugh</strong> and <strong>Louis Schilling</strong>, with 
        a fabulous East Bay pool party. A hectic rehearsal schedule (and appalling 
        Bay Bridge traffic) prevented Ulrica from appearing at the event, but 
        she was delighted to hear that the following &quot;Who's Who&quot; of 
        veteran Supers attended: <strong>Renee DeJarnatt</strong>, <strong>Mark 
        Huelsman</strong>, <strong>Katherine Brazaitis</strong>, <strong>Traude 
        Alpert</strong>, <strong>Karen Goodwyn</strong>, <strong>Susan Anderson</strong> 
        (joined by her husband, <strong>Doug Norby</strong>), <strong>Andrea Kohlruss</strong>, 
        Kimberly Thompson, <strong>David Clover</strong>, Irene Bechtel, and honorees 
        Louis and Laurel and Carolyn (hosting along with her husband, Paul), plus 
        Super pal <strong>Rick Kvistad</strong>, from the Opera Orchestra. The 
        best surprise was a visit from <strong>Don Stoddard</strong>, as upbeat 
        and mischievous as ever! Talk was all about the Costume Sale and the treasures 
        acquired, the recent &quot;who are these people?&quot; cattle call and 
        the state of Supering in general. We raised a birthday toast to the three 
        celebrants and <strong>Ian Mishkin</strong>, about whom we shared fond 
        memories.<br>
        <br>
        All this talk about birthdays reminds me that a few weeks ago my old friend 
        <strong>Licia Albanese</strong> was in town to celebrate her (say it isn&#8217;t 
        so) 93rd.<img src="/funstuff/Ulricasep2005/albatom.jpg" width="225" height="186" align="right"> 
        The Company threw a surprise party, and there to represent the Supernumeraries 
        was our own <strong>Tom Carlisle</strong>, seen happily libiamo-ing alongside 
        the diva. Tom stayed around for Opera in the Park, but flew out the next 
        day bound for the UK and Deutschland. However, he will return later in 
        the season for his role in <em>La Forza del Destino</em>.<br>
        <br>
        Seems as though the whole City is abuzz with things Atomic. The Supers 
        on the job are keeping it hush-hush, but it sounds as though it&#8217;s 
        going to be a spectacular production. Adorable genius director<strong> 
        Peter Sellars</strong> has been going out of his way, I&#8217;m told, 
        to include the Supers (or &#8220;Wonderful Acting Contingent,&#8221; as 
        they are now known) into every stage of the creative process: the very 
        first Supers-only rehearsal was a small meeting during which he described, 
        in depth and at great length, the forces behind the concept of the opera 
        and why we need opera in our lives. Seems his breadth of knowledge on 
        the subject is immense, and unlike many directors we have known, he is 
        more than happy to pass that knowledge along to the humble players. <br>
        <br>
        Amongst those players is a nice mix of old (over 30) and new (under),
         including <strong>Yvette Rosedale</strong> in her first non-cover role,
          certified circus clown <strong>Jeremy Vik</strong>, MP, and opera wife<strong> 
        John Alexander </strong>(his partner is Costume Shop's <strong>Jai Alltizer</strong> of
        the Miro-esque hair), <strong>Al Heiben</strong> in a named part
        (Lt.  Bush, no relation) and, as a sexy WAC, glamorous redhead <strong>Lynn
         Meinhardt</strong>.<br>
        <br>
        As reported elsewhere in these pages, the process of staging the opera 
        is the subject of a documentary film by <strong><a href="/funstuff/Atomic/jonelse.html">Jon 
        Else</a></strong>, so look for SFO Supers on the big screen. Super Captain 
        <strong>Nancy Huie</strong> wonders what they will wear to the Oscars! 
        It was very thoughtful of Jon to hand out DVD copies of his 1980 documentary 
        <em>The Day After Trinity</em> to all cast members. It&#8217;s an amazing 
        film and available for rent through Netflix&#8212;highly recommended. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Speaking of &#8220;Forces,&#8221; why has SFO suddenly decided to translate 
        the names of all the operas this season? Whilst <em>L&#8217;Italiana in 
        Algeri</em> might be a mouthful for some, surely we are all familiar with, 
        and can wrap our tongues around, <em>La Forza del Destino</em>. Seems 
        as though they can&#8217;t give the sophisticated SFO audiences credit 
        for being able to come to grips with any title that isn&#8217;t a character&#8217;s 
        first name (e.g., <em>Norma</em>, <em>Fidelio</em>).<br>
        <br>
        Congratulations to the Supers <a href="/funstuff/Ulricasep2005/candidbig.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/funstuff/Ulricasep2005/candide.jpg" width="225" height="150" hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="left"></a>who 
        traveled thousands of miles and did an outstanding job in two excellent 
        productions (<em><a href="../../events/Festival%20Opera/festivalopera.html">Un 
        Ballo in Maschera</a></em> and <em><a href="../../events/candide/candideintro.html">Candide</a></em>) 
        at Festival Opera in sunny Walnut Creek this Summer. The four guys who 
        worked the latter, <strong>Paul Szczesiul</strong>, <strong>Mike Harvey</strong>, 
        <strong>Charlie Lichtman</strong> and <strong>Bjon Farber</strong>, had 
        an incredible amount of work to do moving the set units around during 
        this very convoluted opera. From what I saw, all went smoothly despite 
        a reported lack of direction. In fact, it fell on Charlie to map all the 
        set changes and movements. After years of hanging around ASMs and watching 
        them take all those notes, he was able to pull it together at the last 
        minute. <em>Bravo</em>!<br>
        <br>
        On a personal note, Ulrica was delighted to see herself so skillfully 
        impersonated by <a href="/funstuff/Ulricasep2005/ulricabig.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/funstuff/Ulricasep2005/ulricasmall.jpg" width="225" height="150" hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="right"></a><strong>Patrice 
        Houston</strong> in FO&#8217;s <em>Ballo</em>, although her entrance from 
        inside a tomb was so much more dramatic a statement than this columnist 
        would ever dare make. Rumour has it that Ulrica and <em>Ballo</em> will 
        return as next season&#8217;s SFO opener. However, as we know, nothing 
        is certain at SFO&#8212;other than that the new GD, <strong>David Gockley</strong>, 
        will stage <em>Florenzia en el Amazonas</em> for us.<br>

        at the <em>Candide</em> final dress was former Super Captain <strong>Albert 
        Goodwyn</strong>, now living in the City and currently stage managing, 
        and appearing, in <em>Much Ado About Nothing</em> for <a href="http://www.sfshakes.org/" target="_blank">Free 
        Shakespeare in the Park</a> at the Presidio. Performances are on Saturdays 
        at 7:30 and Sundays at 2:30 through September 24th. He hopes Supers will 
        come see him there.<br>
        <br>
        Current Super Coordinator <strong>Carrie Murphy</strong> seems to be sporting

        and each, apparently, her &#8220;real color.&#8221;<br>
        <br>
        Well, dear Fan, it's time for me to crawl back under my rock. I promise 
        not to be out of touch for so long. Meanwhile, until we meet offstage
