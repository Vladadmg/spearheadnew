      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">by 
        Tom Reed, chorus</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"> 
        <em>Eugene Onegin</em>! Another fabulous opera for the chorus! As always 
        we start off as a bunch of exhausted, happy peasants coming in from the 
        fields with a song of gratitude for our life of hard labor. Joined by 
        several members of the ballet posing as haystacks we sing, dance, and 
        then get sent away. Soon, however, the women return to do the laundry 
        by the riverbank. There they manage the most marvelous melodies while 
        hanging sheets between themselves and the conductor. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">But 
        later things start really looking up as the chorus ascends to the status 
        of lower upper-class guests at Larina's country house ball. Scrambling 
        over tables via rickety chairs we pose for a group photo in a variety 
        of fun costumes, and then dance ourselves into a bad mood. But then comes 
        the high point of the evening -- the Monsieur Triquet scene. The delighted 
        chorus munches on cake and listens with rapt attention as Triquet, sung 
        by tenor John Duykers, serenades Tatyana with a poem composed in her honor. 
        It was absolutely wonderful! Striking just the right balance between sweet 
        and mellow, the light texture of the tangy lemon bunt cake served as a 
        perfect foil to the gooey sweetness of the frosting. Choristers are normally 
        forbidden to eat in costume without first covering up with bulky choir 
        robes at the insistence of the Wardrobe department whose only concern 
        is the safety and comfort of the costumes. But here we were, dressed to 
        the nines and stuffing our faces right in front of the audience, and the 
        dressers couldn't do a thing about it! Rest assured that three huge bunt 
        cakes had completely disappeared by the end of Triquet's second verse. 
        </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">There's 
        nothing like a tipsy dance to clear a stage full of hyperactive choristers. 
        Joining hands they skip and hop away into the wings. Some are seen upstage 
        carrying Japanese lanterns as they spin and twirl off through the vast 
        northern forest looking heavenward into a lovely snowfall. What a delightful 
        picture! Yes, set designer Peter Pabst has placed dozens of tall birch 
        trees on stage. Ever twirl through a dense forest without looking where 
        you're going? Don't! </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">But 
        the chorus doesn't stay away for long. Back at the party it's the old 
        tenor/baritone rivalry once again as Lensky and Onegin duke it out in 
        front of the shocked guests. It's to be pistols at dawn. But that's nothing 
        compared to the real battle yet to come. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;"><font size="2">While Lensky and 
        Onegin duel, down in the basement dressing rooms the women prepare for 
        the big hoopskirt ball. Yes, keeping with this season's &quot;boats n' 
        hoops&quot; theme, the women are costumed in enormous eight-foot hoops 
        -- even bigger than the <em>Dutchma</em>n and <em>Traviata</em> hoops 
        combined! Dressers, who have been warned to get all their affairs in order 
        before arriving for work, heap piles of fabric upon their hapless victims 
        who must also endure a makeup change, and don oversized headdresses that 
        have been described as like wearing a potted plant on one's head. But 
        the hoops can only be put on upstairs in the cramped wings because they 
        are too wide for even the grand staircase that leads from the dressing 
        rooms to the stage. So each woman must lug over twenty yards of </font></p>
      <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></td>
    <td width="238" rowspan="2" valign="top" class="spearhead"><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="col2" --> 
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">fabric 
        up the steps draped over each arm. Then just offstage they meet with their 
        dressers -- two dressers per woman -- who escort them to where their assigned 
        hoops have been laid out on the floor in a tight pattern in the extremely 
        limited space. Holding their dresses as high as possible they step into 
        their hoops. One dresser in the back then attempts to lift the hoops into 
        place, while the other struggles in the front to tie them around the waist. 
        Of course at the same time huge parts of the set are rolling past for 
        the scene change, and the chorus men are fighting their way through to 
        their entrance positions as frantic dressers tug and shout &quot;Tighter! 
        Tighter!!&quot; </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Then 
        out of nowhere someone shouts &quot;Go!&quot; and the elegantly dressed 
        men (now upper class) file onto the stage and promenade in a kind of aristocratic 
        goosestep, soon to be joined by their remarkably composed hooped companions. 
        After a short stroll the men retire upstage for a breather, leaving the 
        ladies spread out across the entire stage where they execute in unison 
        a graceful twenty-second curtsey that takes them all the way down to the 
        stage floor! This astounding feat is accomplished by placing one knee 
        behind the other, locking the face into the smiling position, and then 
        ever so slowly descending to the floor, inch by agonizing inch, while 
        maintaining perfect poise and balance. Deep religious faith doesn't necessarily 
        spring to mind when one thinks about choristers, but it was abundantly 
        evident to those close enough to overhear so many entreaties to the Almighty! 
        After leaving them lying there on the floor in that state for several 
        minutes the men return to retrieve their companions. Of course recognizing 
        one's partner isn't as easy as it sounds, considering that approaching 
        from behind all one sees is fabric and feathers. It does make for a few 
        terrifying seconds. And, oh yes, it also falls to the men to get the ladies 
        back to their feet again. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">But 
        the curtain calls at the end of the evening make it all worthwhile... 
        despite having to crush through the wings, relocate our partners and jockey 
        for the most down-stage bowing position, all in just a matter of seconds. 
        It's the applause -- that's what opera's all about. That, and the cake.
