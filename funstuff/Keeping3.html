        <font size="2">The safest and surest way to stay in tempo with the conductor
                    is of course to ignore the conductor and prompter altogether,
                    and instead observe the bow
  of the first violinist. The violins play more than any other instrument in
  the orchestra. The first violinist&#8217;s beat is easily discernable, and
  his proximity to the conductor&#8217;s podium allows choristers to appear to
  be faithfully observing the conductor while in reality watching the first violinist&#8217;s
  bow. This is an important consideration if dealing with the rare conductor
  that actually looks at the chorus. In truth, choristers may acquire the beat
  by staring at almost any member of the string section, but predicting when
  a conductor is going to look at the chorus is an acquired skill that should
  be left only to the bold. Better to watch the first violinist and thus avoid
  accusations of daydreaming on stage. Besides, conductors frequently add extra
  beats when attempting to push the orchestra into a faster tempo, leading to
  all kinds of confusion on stage. <br>
        <br>
        Watching the first violinist has the added advantage of giving
                    the chorus an instant heads-up on which of the conductor&#8217;s
                    beats the orchestra will choose to ignore.<br>
        The greatest threat to choral unity comes from the fact that
                    the chorus is usually scattered all over the stage. Again,
                    because sound takes time to travel,
  the voices at the back reach the audience later than those nearer the front.
  The situation is further complicated by the little known fact that when operatic
  choristers sing, they hear only themselves. Over the sound of their own bombastic
  voices they can&#8217;t hear the person next to them, much less the orchestra.
  Therefore those near the back of the stage, unable to see or hear, should rely
  on a trusted chorister near the front of the stage. Choose a reliable chorister
  who tends to bounce up and down in tempo as he or she sings. Such individuals
  are invaluable as choristers because they physically broadcast the beat, usually
  thrash their heads left and right on cut-offs, and their enthusiasm tends to
  lead them to the front of the stage where they have an unobstructed view of
  the first violin. Choristers in the back should try to sing slightly ahead
  of the bouncing chorister, but there&#8217;s no need to get too compulsive
  about it. If the front/back time lag turns the chorus text into mush, it will
  just be attributed to bad diction and ultimately blamed on the language coach.<br>
        <br>
        One last thing. When wrongly blamed for a tempo mishap over
                    which you had absolutely no control, a heartfelt apology,
                    especially one that includes the word &quot;maestro&quot;,
  never fails to impress. </font></font></font></p>
