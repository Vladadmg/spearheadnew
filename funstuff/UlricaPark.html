      <h2><font size="2">Ulrica in the 
        Park -- Sunday September 7th, 2003</font></h2>
      <p><font size="2">Once again thousands 
        of people poured into Golden Gate Park&#8217;s Sharon Meadow to attend 
        and picnic at SFO&#8217;s freebie, Opera in the Park, among them, of course, 
        your <em>Spearhead</em> correspondent, Ulrica.<br>
        <br>
        <img src="../images/druid%20and%20riverdance.jpg" width="250" height="220" align="left">Always
         willing to embarrass themselves in front of thousands of people, several
        
        Supers showed up in costume to help hand out season schedules and direct
         folks to the Opera booth where they were having a 2-for-1 special on
        tickets. 
        <strong>Charlie Lichtman</strong> (left) wore his actual costume from
         the old production of <em>Norma</em> (purchased at the Costume Shop
         sale  a few years back) and looked quite the Druid, while many thought
         that 
        <strong>Andrew Korniej </strong>(right), unfortunately, looked more like
         a jigging Irish colleen from <em>Riverdance</em> than the Renaissance
          Man he aspired to be. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><img src="../images/annalaurel.jpg" width="208" height="275" align="right"></font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Ophelia wannabe 
        <strong>Anna Stultz </strong>(right) looked suitably ethereal in flowing 
        green chiffon and Twisted Sister <strong>Laurel Winzler</strong> (left) 
        worked the crowd wearing an authentic embroidered Hungarian folk costume. 
        Nice to see Medieval historian/Jeopardy contestant <strong>Dan Melia </strong>as 
        Wozzeck and swashbuckling <strong>Walt Thorpe</strong> as a pirate; presumably 
        from Penzance.<br>
        <br>
        When the crowd wasn&#8217;t admiring the Supers&#8217; costumes they seemed 
        to be enjoying the concert. Adorable <em>Magic Flute</em>-ists Charles 
        Castronova and Ana Maria Martinez were a gigantic hit with their delightful 
        &quot;Esultate pur la barbara&#8221; from<em> L&#8217;Elisir D&#8217;Amore, 
        </em>followed by Suzanne Ramo's stunning, note-perfect Queen of the Night 
        aria. Also from the <em>Zauberfl&ouml;te</em> cast, Twyla Robinson was 
        the afternoon&#8217;s most adventurous performer with an exciting aria 
        and caballeta from the early Verdi rarity <em>I Due Foscari</em>. There 
        was an audible gasp of admiration when the extremely handsome baritone 
        Nathan Gunn took the stage to sing &#8220;Largo al factotum&#8221; and 
        the instant he finished singing there was a stampede of people heading 
        towards the Opera booth to snag Twofers for his <em>Barber</em>.<br>
        <br>
        The afternoon&#8217;s funniest moment was Frederica von Stade and Zheng 
        Cao doing the &#8220;Habanera&#8221; <em>&agrave; deux</em>: one in French, 
        the other in Mandarin; one flashing her fan, the other donning a Chinese 
        straw hat. &quot;Flicka&quot; also dedicated a &#8220;love song&#8221; 
        to the San Francisco Opera Company (she specified the Orchestra and Chorus 
        but we&#8217;re sure her failure to mention the Supernumeraries was just 
        a Senior Moment. Certainly her backstage schmoozing with <strong>Charlie 
        Lichtman</strong> would suggest nothing but solidarity with the Super 
        Corps) in the form of a luscious, creamy rendition of her trademark &#8220;Voi 
        che sapete.&#8221; Surprisingly this was beloved Flicka&#8217;s Opera 
        in the Park debut! Brava!!<br>
        <br>
        <img src="../images/WaltCharlieTom.jpg" width="300" height="223" align="left">Other 
        Supers spied in the audience included <em>Spearhead</em> Editor Emeritus 
        <strong>Tom Carlisle</strong> (at far right, with Lichtman and Thorpe) 
        with the latest volume of his magnificent scrapbooks (covering Summer 
        2002. Look for it at the next Bake Sale), <strong>David Ransom</strong>, 
        <strong>Lucas Rebston</strong> and Tiburon goldsmith <strong>Keith Bartel</strong>. 
        Spotted in the senior &amp; handicapped seating area was Screen Star Sharon 
        Stone with (we thought ex-) husband, <em>Chronicle</em> editor Phil Bronstein. 
        <br>
        <br>
        As usual the afternoon ended with several <em>Traviata</em> &#8220;Libiamos&#8221; 
        successively led by Mr. Castronovo with Ms. Martinez and tenor Antonio 
        Nagore with glam returning diva Catherine Nagelstad. After libiaming much 
        too much, and overcome by her whiff of backstage testosterone, Ulrica 
        grabbed her picnic hamper and staggered home, humming that catchy Overture 
        to <em>Benvenuto Cellini</em> all the way.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"><strong>Addios 
        to Terry and Todd</strong></font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"><br>
        We have happy and sad feelings about departing SFO Company members <strong>Todd 
        Calvin</strong> and <strong>Terry Ganley</strong>. </font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;"><font size="2"><br>
        Former Super Captain Todd (pictured at right) is heading back to where
             he left his heart, Southern California, for a new career in the
            Entertainment 
        Capital, Los Angeles. <img src="../images/Todd.jpg" width="200" height="266" align="right">Good
         luck, Todd and it was really great working with you for the two seasons.
        
        We all remember Todd&#8217;s Trial by Fire, the 2001 Verdi Festival <em>Aida</em>.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">He&#8217;s hoping 
        to be able to join us for Oliver&#8217;s <a href="pollardretro/pollardintro.html" target="_blank">Farewell 
        Party</a> on September 22nd and we&#8217;re hoping he&#8217;ll be back 
        to visit often. Todd is a man of many talents: Apart from the daunting 
        task of being Super Captain he has been in charge of all scheduling at 
        the Opera, passed the California Bar and produced an Emmy-nominated film, 
        <em>Off Season,</em> for Showtime last year. Best wishes and every success 
        in SoCal, Todd!<br>
        <br>
        And flying East this very week is Stage Manager extraordinaire Terry Ganley, 
        seen here (below, right) with Sandy Bernhardt and a couple of Heyducks. 
        <img src="../images/terry.jpg" width="250" height="286" align="left">Terry 
        has landed a fabulous SM (that&#8217;s Stage Manager, my dears) job at 
        the Metropolitan Opera. We heartily congratulate her on the new position 
        but we&#8217;ll miss the frizzy hair, the crisp professional voice over 
        the PR, the dry humor and inevitable backstage &#8220;Quiet PLEASE!&#8221; 
        on those rare occasions when the Super Corps would get out of control. 
        We also know that Terry&#8217;s extreme diligence with onstage safety 
        will mean no more Met Supers falling into the Orchestra Pit. <br>
        <strong><br>
        Warm and Fuzzy</strong><br>
        <br>
        A magical highlight of SFO&#8217;s <em>Magic Flute</em> is the scene where 
        woodland creatures come out of the woods and are transfixed by Tamino&#8217;s 
        playing. Said creatures are great, albeit unseen, roles for Supers. Ulrica 
        worries that the Supers will miss playing these roles once the performances 
        are over. So she suggests that they read this <a href="http://www.sfbg.com/SFLife/32/47/furries.html" target="_blank">article</a> 
        from the <em>San Francisco Bay Guardian</em>. They might also want to 
        check out the ultimate unseen animal role and rent this <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042546/" target="_blank">movie</a>. 
        But she suggests that if you are wearing <a href="http://www.blackglama.com/" target="_blank">this</a> 
        you best avoid showing up <a href="http://worldanimal.net/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Culture Vulture Ulrica couldn&#8217;t help but notice that <strong>Mike 
        Harvey</strong>&#8217;s dragon costume in the above mentioned opera appears 
        in <img src="../images/5dragon1.jpg" width="300" height="231" align="right">The 
        National Gallery of London&#8217;s treasure &quot;St. George and the Dragon,&quot; 
        <em>circa</em> 1470, by Paolo Uccello. We know the production is showing 
        its age but can it really be that dated? <br>
        <br>
        Until the next column, Ulrica will be getting her Easter Bunny costume 
        out of mothballs and joining you all onstage.</font></p>
