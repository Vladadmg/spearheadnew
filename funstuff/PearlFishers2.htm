        <em>Act I</em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">On 
        a hot beach in Ceylon a bunch of choristers complain in high-speed French 
        about how the burning sand keeps them constantly dancing. (“<em>Sur la 
        greve en feu</em>”). A group of vacationing plumbers brags about its skill 
        at breaking up clogs. (“<em>Plongeurs audacieux</em>”) Apparently dissatisfied 
        with the local food, they decide to elect Zurga as chef, and then must 
        hang around while someone searches for a virgin to pray for better weather. 
        Meanwhile Zurga's childhood friend (with the depressing name of Nadir) 
        shows up out of nowhere, and the two reminisce about a beautiful woman 
        they once saw at a church fondue social. (“<em>Au fond du temple saint</em>”) 
        At last someone locates a virgin, slaps her in a see-through burqa, and 
        hauls her in to perform the weather ceremony. She turns out to be Le&iuml;la, 
        the fondue girl. She likes the outfit and all the attention, but Zurga 
        makes her swear to remain pure, and promises that if she remains chaste, 
        she'll be given a pearl. Well, big deal! I mean, this is a pearl fishing 
        village after all, so the whole town's awash in pearls. Why trade love 
        for something she can get on any corner? But when she seems to balk, the 
        crowd turns vicious. So she responds, “<em>Je reste ici quand j'y devrais 
        mourir!</em>” (&quot;Alright, already!&quot;) So they stick her on a rock 
        overlooking the ocean, and the murderous crowd instantly gets religion. 
        But trouble's brewing because Nadir's definitely in love. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em>Act 
        II </em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Night 
        falls, and Le&iuml;la's already bored. The high priest Nourabad's a real 
        drag, and the townsfolk seem completely obsessed with the weather. She's 
        starting to feel like a twelve o'clock girl in a nine o'clock town when 
        Nadir decides to drop by the rock, and things start looking up. She shatters 
        her vows on the spot. With that, last night's thunderstorm comes rolling 
        in from St. Petersburg as part of this season's “Boats 'n' Bolts” theme. 
        Clearly the gods prefer that Leila not get off her rock. The chorus mobs 
        up the ramps for the chaotic storm scene, when someone (how shall I put 
        this delicately?) cuts a <em>grand fromage</em>. The same exact thing 
        happened during the dress rehearsal! Apparently someone can't handle sudden 
        changes in the weather. And of course the more the crowd dashes about 
        singing “<em>O nuit de pouvante!</em>”, the more it spreads. Somehow when 
        Bizet wrote a thunderstorm scene for a crowd of Hindu pearl fishers, I 
        don't think he envisioned a stage full of panicked choristers, dancers 
        and supers muttering, “Oh Christ!” under their breath as they try to dodge 
        a methane cloud. Nourabad blames it on Nadir and Le&iuml;la. This time 
        the crowd turns really vicious. Zurga cites the two for disturbing the 
        peace, which in this very conservative town comes with the death penalty. 
        The mob thanks the heavens for blessing them with a double execution.</font></p>

        III </em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Zurga's 
        having second thoughts - not about Leila - about Nadir. After all, they 
        were once “<em>tendr' ami</em>”. Leila figures she can work the noble 
        angle, so she pleads for Nadir's life instead of her own. But it backfires 
        as jealous Zurga sings “<em>Tu demandais sa vie</em>.” (“Now you're really 
        gonna get it.”) So Leila, trying out the pity angle, asks if she might 
        return her necklace to her mother. It's the most darling little broach 
        encrusted with real stage diamonds. But the second that Nourabad sees 
        it he just has to have it, and rudely snatches it out of her hand. Zurga 
        begins to think that maybe he's being a little harsh.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">The 
        townsfolk whip up a wild celebration as Nadir and Le&iuml;la are hauled 
        in. It's the most fun this dreary burg has seen in ages. Everything's 
        ready for the big execution. They wave their arms in the air and sing 
        about going topless. (“<em>Nos bras flopperont</em>”) Zurga, ever a crowd 
        pleaser, has just suggested that Leila shed her uncomfortable top (“<em>Zurga 
        la livre &agrave; vos bras irrit&eacute;s</em>”) when the whole town suddenly 
        goes up in smoke. The fire was Zurga's idea, thinking the citizenry could 
        use a nice light-show. As the populace goes off to watch their homes burn 
        down, Zurga decides to let Nadir and Leila escape, figuring he can provide 
        the entertainment when the mob gets back.</font></p>
