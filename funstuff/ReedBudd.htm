        Willy Decker's sizzling production of Benjamin Britten's acclaimed opera 
        &quot;Billy Budd&quot; opened Sunday at the San Francisco Opera. The Herman 
        Melville novel upon which the opera is based ever so subtly hints at suppressed 
        eroticism; so subtly as to escape the attention of most readers of the 
        time. Britten noticed, however. While his opera may be set on the open 
        sea, one could say that the real action takes place just below the surface, 
        if one is willing to go snorkeling. But Willy Decker's production has 
        blown the doors right off Davy Jones' locker. If Melville hints, and Britten 
        suggests, then Decker downright insists! In fact, if you're looking for 
        the ship that dare not speak its name, this Budd's for you!! </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">In 
        a brief prologue, Captain Vere reminisces about his days long ago commanding 
        the H.M.S. Indomitable, and a certain young sailor. Act One flashes back 
        to the French wars of 1797 where a younger Vere and his crew hope to engage 
        the enemy in battle. A cutter has been dispatched to &quot;board a passing 
        merchantman&quot; where they &quot;pick up&quot; three sailors, one of 
        them being young Billy Budd, the role sung by baritone knockout Nathan 
        &quot;Gunn.&quot; From the moment Billy sets foot onboard, Master-At-Arms 
        Claggart can't take his eyes off him. Billy, handsome and anxious to please, 
        quickly becomes quite popular. His only failing is a &quot;speech impediment.&quot; 
        Yeah. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">All 
        hands scramble onto the deck to pull the ropes and hoist the sails. The 
        ropes must of course appear to be taut. Just so you know, with ninety-five 
        choristers and supers on stage and only a handful of stage crew pulling 
        back from the offstage side, our labors must only be simulated in order 
        to avoid dragging the stagehands onto the set. But as one of those lucky 
        choristers, I can tell you that if the pulling is faked, the tension on 
        those ropes is definitely not! Having to repeatedly run offstage through 
        an exit that's too small, and pull your way back onto an over-crowded 
        set with no place to step except on the feet of your colleagues, while 
        at the same time fighting to see the conductor and sing a rhythmically 
        tricky sequence of &quot;heaves,&quot; does tend to make the tension on 
        those ropes real! </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">The 
        crew warns Billy that Claggart is out to get him, but Billy is only interested 
        in Captain Vere, whom he says he will follow forever. That night after 
        a flogging, the crew throws a festive party on deck, hosted by Bikini 
        Boy, the crew's resident cross-dresser. While the men sing about &quot;sailing 
        off to Gibraltar in only a halter&quot; Corporal Squeak accuses Billy 
        of &quot;throttling&quot; him, and things quickly turn vicious. As Squeak 
        lunges, someone shouts, &quot;Look out! He's got a WIFE!!!&quot; Or was 
        it &quot;knife&quot;? Whatever. Everyone recoils in horror. But Billy 
        gains the upper hand and emerges triumphant from the scuffle. Distracted 
        by shirtless Billy's enormous pecs, Claggart tells him to take a pride 
        in his dress. Billy finds this a bit odd since he's actually wearing a 
        pair of low-cut white cotton duck bellbottoms, with hip-hugging waist 
        cinch, button-down front flap, brushed silver buttons, and distressed 
        leather pumps. But who is he to question the fantasies of a superior officers? 
        Billy heads below deck in search of a better outfit. Meanwhile the flat-chested 
        and unpopular Claggart could just pee with envy. So he starts dissing 
        Billy at every turn, even to the Captain. However Vere, better known to 
        the crew as &quot;Starry,&quot; won't hear anything bad about &quot;Beauty&quot; 
        Budd. Yeah. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Exhausted 
        from a day of flogging, frolicking, and endless exiting and reentering, 
        the chorus squashes once more offstage to sing &quot;Over The Water,&quot; 
        a haunting little ditty that is made all the more poignant by the fact 
        that exiting a ship at sea via the starboard bow does indeed put one literally 
        over the water. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;"><font size="2">A 
        few days later (Act Two) a lookout spots a French vessel several miles 
        off the starboard bow. The Indomitable gives chase. Red Whiskers and Danskers 
        volunteer to join the party that will be the first to board the French 
        vessel in the smoky battle. While the chorus grumbles something about 
        boredom in the smoke, a voice is heard from high overhead. It's Billy. 
        He wants to party too! Now everyone gets in the mood. With the tenors 
        cheering and pointing up to Billy in the rigging, the rest of the chorus 
        is surprised to see Billy walk on stage down left. No matter. Everything's 
        set for the big battle. </font></p>

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">The 
        captain gives orders to load the cannon. Working themselves to a fever 
        pitch the crew crushes repeatedly offstage and back on through the narrow, 
        funnel-shaped exit as officers shout orders, powder monkeys dart about 
        dispensing ammunition, and sailors scramble in every direction in a chaotic 
        frenzy unlike anything since the <a href="TomOnTrav.htm">big party scene 
        in <em>La Traviata</em></a>. To simulate the firing of the cannon offstage, 
        huge speakers were set up in the wings next to an enormous flash pot filled 
        with flash powder &#8211; the stuff the old cameras used to use before 
        the invention of flashbulbs. The order is given to fire and the chorus 
        crushes offstage toward the cannon shouting &quot;HURRAAAaaaaaaaah!&quot; 
        just as the blinding flash goes off in our faces. Dazed and unable to 
        see, we squeeze toward the mushroom cloud, squash through the narrow exit 
        and grope our way down the treacherous offstage ramp in the dark, all 
        the while singing and squinting desperately at the monitor located conveniently 
        next to two glaring spotlights, only to have to turn right around and 
        shove our way back onstage where they inform us that we MISSED! I don't 
        need to tell you that we're not at all pleased. Then the fog comes in, 
        the French ship escapes, and we have to exit AGAIN! This time the principals 
        have to threaten us before we'll squash ourselves back onto that ramp. 
        </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Meanwhile 
        Claggart chooses the wrong time to needle Billy about his speech impediment, 
        and Billy bitch-slaps him dead.... right in front of the Captain. Pity! 
        Billy gets a court-martial. Now what is Vere going to do? He'd like to 
        be lenient and overlook Billy's silly little mistake. After all, boys 
        will be boys. But if he isn't strict with Billy, what will people think? 
        Vere wouldn't want anyone to get the &quot;wrong&quot; impression. Nooooo. 
        So he leaves Billy's fate up to the officers, assuming that they will 
        just slap him on the wrist. Well, guess what. The officers wouldn't want 
        anyone to get the &quot;wrong&quot; impression either! So they do the 
        butch thing. They decide to hang him from the yardarm. Poor Billy. This 
        cruise has turned out to be the pits! </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">The 
        chorus isn't amused about being dragged back to the stage yet again, even 
        for a hanging, and the grumbling finally breaks out into open rebellion. 
        The principals manage to force us upstage and quell the mutiny, but there's 
        no way they can make us go down that infernal exit ramp again! They have 
        to end the act by bring in the blackout curtain.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">The 
        epilogue takes us back to the present, where Vere, now retired, is still 
        going on and on about Billy. In fact he's been at it for three hours! 
        But he claims to be older and wiser now, and completely over it. Yeah. 
        Sure, honey. Whatever you say. </font></p>
