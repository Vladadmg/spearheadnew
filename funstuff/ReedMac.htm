        Tom Reed, Chorus</strong></font><strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"> 
        At last! An opera that the audience doesn't understand either! <em>Le 
        Grand Macabre</em> is the great equalizer. Normally we choristers experience 
        the show only in bits and pieces. If we're not actually in a scene, we're 
        told to clear off and wait in our dressing rooms. But then on cue we're 
        expected to pop back onstage fully engaged, as if we know everything we 
        just missed. Well, in this opera, even with the advantage of actually 
        seeing the show, the audience is just as baffled as we are. Or are they? 
        </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">How 
        does one describe an opera such as this? You know how a Big Mac sandwich 
        is thought of as a single unit, but in reality it is an amalgam of many 
        different ingredients, flavors and textures? It starts with multiple layers 
        of bread that both support and separate two distinct patties of beef. 
        Acting together they separately form the base of the sandwich. One patty 
        is topped with cheese. But the other is covered with spicy onions, zesty 
        pickles, crisp lettuce and tangy/mellow secret sauce. Yet when consumed, 
        all ten layers meld into a single, delicious experience called The Big 
        Mac. Well, just put that image out of your mind. There's no point in thinking 
        about food, because <em>Le Grand Macabre</em> isn't anything like that. 
        </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Hungarian 
        composer Gy&ouml;rgy Ligeti's early experiences with Nazis and Communists 
        may have influenced his sense of humor. He's able to chuckle at all of 
        life's petty annoyances. Death, for example. Who knew it was such a laugh 
        riot? His musical score may seem complex, but in truth it can be summed 
        up in one uncomplicated image: A Looney Tune orchestra playing Vivaldi's 
        “Tom and Jerry,” Beethoven's “Fiddle Dee Dee,” Stravinsky's “Wrongs of 
        Spring,” and “Slop &amp; Chop” Joplin … while riding a poorly maintained 
        subway train … through Transylvania … with a gaggle of unhappy geese … 
        during the Blitz. It's that simple. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Before 
        the curtain rises, when the announcer tells the audience to switch off 
        their cell phones, they should also tell them to switch off the left side 
        of their brains. In this opera you just have to go with the flow. It makes 
        no sense whatsoever, except as a political cartoon. In that regard it 
        mirrors our society perfectly, which is to say again that it makes no 
        sense whatsoever. </font></p>

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">It's 
        a charming story about Death with a capital D. Going by the name of Nekrotzar, 
        Death just wants to be taken seriously by the citizens of Breughelland. 
        He figures he can get their attention by destroying the world. But the 
        citizenry has other things on its mind. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">In 
        the first scene the chorus reacts in horror at the appearance of Nekrotzar 
        as he rides up from the grave on an escalator. To maintain the required 
        “Quasimodo in Hell” postures throughout the long scene, some resort to 
        a simple acting technique &#8212; tightening every muscle on just one 
        side of the body. Though difficult at first to hold, these tortured postures 
        and expressions get easier as the scene progresses, due to the tendency 
        of muscles to lock once they cramp. Thereafter no effort is required, 
        except backstage when it comes time to pry loose. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">In 
        one of the most shocking and disgusting scenes of the evening, the chorus 
        enters to discover several tables spread with food. At first they approach 
        the feast with caution, but gradually they lose all sense of decorum, 
        eventually shoving, grabbing and wallowing over each other in a gluttonous 
        feeding frenzy. And all this takes place during intermission in the basement 
        employee lounge right in front of the lovely lady volunteers of the Opera 
        Guild who had intended the refreshments for the members of the orchestra! 
        Disgraceful! </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Later 
        on stage they do it again! After attending a raucous political convention 
        the chorus breaks into a banquet like a swarm of locusts and devours everything, 
        even the fake stuff. It requires none less than the Grim Reaper himself 
        to drive them off! What is it about singers and food? </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">But 
        at the real crux of the story is humanity's propensity for following its 
        leaders off a cliff. Nekrotzar's fear-mongering turns ultimately into 
        a self-apocalypse, and the people survive to see the value of living without 
        fear. Would that politics were so simple, and so much fun. </font></p>
