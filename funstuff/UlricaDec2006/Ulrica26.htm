        <br>
        Seems just a few days ago that Ulrica was reporting on the glamour of 
        <a href="../UlricaSep2006/Ulrica25.htm">Opening Night</a> and <em><a href="../UlricaAug06/Ulrica24.htm">Un 
        Ballo in Maschera</a></em>. Now here she already is, reporting on the 
        bitter sweetness of our end-of-season parties. Is time really rushing 
        by so quickly or can she have been in a blackout these past two months?</font><font size="2"><br>
        <br>
        <strong>The Grand Super Party</strong><br>
        <br>
        Although we Supers are not known to be a particularly nautical lot (unless 
        riding the waves in <em>Billy Budd</em> or <em>Death of Klinghoffer</em>), 
        the highlight of the Supers&#8217; season took place, for the second year 
        in a row, at the exclusive Golden Gate Yacht Club in the Marina, thanks, 
        again, to club member (and Super) <strong>Sharon Castle</strong>. <br>
        <br>
        Once again the event was costume-optional and both <strong>Kimberly Thompson</strong> 
        and <strong>Irene Bechtel</strong> paid tribute to the Mystic East. Irene/Indira 
        (recently back from a visit to the subcontinent) wore an especially gorgeous 
        Indian sari and, as Principessa Turandot, Kimberly looked appropriately 
        beguiling in elaborate headdress, black silk Chinese gown, and opera-length 
        gloves. The ever lovely <strong>Priscilla Lore</strong>, wearing her grandmother&#8217;s 
        gorgeous vintage-1930s black-lace gown, reminded Ulrica of a <em>Thin 
        Man-</em>era <strong>Myrna Loy</strong>, all the way down to the martini 
        in hand.<img src="newpics/3ladies.jpg" width="300" height="160" vspace="3"> 
        Spearheader <strong>Lynn Meinhardt</strong> looked sensational in a bedizened 
        gown and headdress from <em>The Tsar&#8217;s Bride</em> (worn by <strong>Anna 
        Netrebko</strong>)<img src="newpics/lynn.jpg" width="300" height="247" vspace="3">It 
        was nice to see one of our other &eacute;migr&eacute; Supers, <strong>Bruce 
        McNaughton </strong>(below right), in town for the various parties and 
        openings of the last few weeks.<img src="newpics/Bruce.jpg" width="300" height="211" vspace="3"> 
        Bruce has been elevated to Super Captain of the <a href="http://www.toledoopera.org/" target="_blank">Toledo 
        (Ohio) Opera</a> and recently reprised his r&ocirc;le in <em>Carmen</em> 
        there.<br>
        <br>
        After opening with a cocktail hour plus, we took our seats. In keeping 
        with the toney setting, the Patrician A- and B-list tables wisely had 
        little place cards, which helped prevent unseemly brawls amongst Super 
        Committee Members and their spice.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Honored Guests</strong><br>
        <br>
        New General Director <strong>David Gockley</strong> made an early, but 
        perfectly timed, appearance, and gave a standing-ovation-generating speech 
        of gratitude for our efforts and commitment to the Opera. He then patiently 
        and meticulously visited each and every table, shaking all extended hands. 
        <img src="newpics/gockley3.jpg" width="300" height="198" vspace="3"><br>
        Mr. Gockley was the lucky recipient of the limited-edition black-and-gold 
        Super tee-shirt. My spies tell me that there are still a few available, 
        but that they are going fast. If you still don&#8217;t have one don&#8217;t 
        miss out, contact Committee Member and Super salesperson <a href="mailto:ktinmp@yahoo.com">Katie 
        Heibein</a> immediately!<br>
        <br>
        While some may object to the Yacht Club&#8217;s lack of a stage space 
        that precludes having a Super skit, others welcomed the opportunity to 
        enjoy alternate forms of entertainment.<br>
        <br>
        This year, in a brilliant move (whose idea was it?) the Committee invited 
        three popular members of the SFO chorus to entertain us by singing for 
        their supper. First up was Super spouse (wife of <strong>Joe Giammarco</strong>) 
        <strong>Claire Kelm</strong>, who looked absolutely radiant in cerise 
        satin and filled the room with a ravishing &quot;Musetta&#8217;s Waltz&quot; 
        and Nedda&#8217;s aria from <em>Pagliacci</em>.<img src="newpics/clairjoe.jpg" width="300" height="304" vspace="3"><br>
        Claire was followed by chorus tenor <strong>Siegmund Siegel</strong> (there 
        with his Super consort <strong>Karen Goodwyn</strong>), who sang arias 
        from <em>Rigoletto</em> and <em>Faust</em>, and then by Super favorite 
        <strong>Fred Matthews</strong> who, in Cole Porter&#8217;s &#8220;From 
        This Moment On,&#8221; insisted on &#8220;no more blue songs, only whoop-di-doop 
        songs,&#8221; a sentiment Ulrica most heartily agrees with.<br>
        <br>
        This year's seven Super Committee members had put together the biggest 
        and best Super party yet, with excellent food (and lots of it) and a program 
        that moved along swimmingly. <a href="../../events/2006Party/hammies.html">Hammy 
        Awards</a> were handed out to winners <strong>Rob Wonder</strong>, Irene 
        Bechtel (whose acceptance speech was funny and sweet), <strong>John F 
        Martin</strong> (his third), and the entire Super cast of <em>Manon Lescaut</em>, 
        which had opened that very afternoon. Hammy maker <strong>John Janonis</strong> 
        must have put in many extra hours to produce so many spear-carrying piglets! 
        Sadly absent were awardees <strong>Michael Strickland</strong>, <strong>Bradly 
        Hamilton</strong>, <strong>Yvette Forte Rosedale</strong> and <em>Tristan</em> 
        stage diver <strong>Kurt Krikorian</strong>.</font></p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0;"><font size="2"><br>
        (It seems as though Bradly has slipped out of town, unfeted. He is visiting 
        family in New England before embarking on a six-month around-the-world 
        journey and re-settlement in rural Vermont. Good luck, Bradly. Missing 
        you already.)<br>
        <br>
        But who was more worthy of a Hammy Award than <em>Carmen</em>&#8217;s 
        <strong>Eddy Gordillo</strong> for his masterful performance at the top 
        of Act One, carrying a huge side of pork across stage?<img src="newpics/eddy.jpg" width="300" height="246" vspace="3"><br>
        Thanks for services rendered went out from MC Katie Heibein to, among 
        others, rubber stamper <strong>Renee De Jarnatt</strong>, aforementioned 
        Hammy maker John Janonis, and Webmaster <strong>Mike Harvey</strong> and 
        Editor <strong>Mark Burstein</strong>, together with the rest of the <strong><a href="../../whoarewe.html"><em>Spearhead 
        </em>team</a></strong>. <br>
        <br>
        The undisputed star of the evening, however, was our new Super Coordinator, 
        <strong>April Busch</strong>, whose heartfelt speech of appreciation, 
        and popular choices for <a href="../../committee/Super%20of%20the%20Year/superoftheyear.html">Super 
        of the Year Award</a> -- tireless, but <img src="DSCN0576-1.jpg" width="300" height="450"><br>
        absent, <strong>Susan Anderson-Norby</strong> (above), diligent, and present, 
        <strong>Joan Imbeau </strong>(below), and seemingly<img src="newpics/moneyjoan.jpg" width="300" height="271" vspace="3"> 
        omnipresent <strong>Paul Szczesiul</strong> -- ended this wonderful evening 
        on a very warm and satisfying note.<br>
        <br>

        As everyone was filing out at 10:30, Claire Kelm, the evening&#8217;s 
        star chanteuse, was spotted finally wolfing down her warmed-up chicken 
        and polenta dinner. <br>
        <br>
        Two days later it was whoop-di-doop time again at the Company party following 
        the opening of Super-intensive <em>Carmen</em>. Another feast was at hand 
        courtesy of the Company and patrons <strong>Annette Campbell-White</strong> 
        and <strong>Ruedi Naumann-Etienne</strong>.</font></p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Again 
        Mr. Gockley worked the room, visiting every table before embarking on 
        a sincere and thorough list of thank-yous to the members of the Company 
        or &#8220;stockholders in the Company&#8221; as he metaphorically referred 
        to all of us. His thanks to &#8220;our corps of Supers&#8221; were extended 
        at an appropriate point in the litany; not as an embarrassed mention at 
        the very end. Never have we been thanked so much, by so many, in so few 
        days.<img src="gockley2.jpg" width="300" height="200" vspace="3"><br>
        <br>
        Ulrica wistfully remembers the <strong>Pamela Rosenberg</strong> speech 
        ending &#8220;And I am so grateful for our wonderful Super ... pause ...Titles&#8221; 
        (sigh). <br>
        <br>
        <strong>More on Our Parking Problems</strong><br>
        <br>
        A very welcome guest at the Company party was Channel 7 News anchor <strong>Dan 
        Ashley</strong>. Dan had put together the wonderful, Super-inclusive <a href="../../committee/Parking.htm">news 
        item</a> on car break-ins and vandalism in the Civic Center which had 
        aired on November 19th. Seems as though the subject is gaining momentum, 
        with an <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2006/12/01/EDGOULJ4V11.DTL" target="_blank">editorial</a> 
        in the <em>SF Chronicle</em> (December 1st) and a KCBS radio report; a 
        puddle of broken auto glass is becoming the emblem of this particular 
        form of violence. Dan, who arrived at the party by cab -- wisely refusing 
        to park in the neighborhood -- is planning a follow-up report on the problem 
        within the next few weeks.<br>
        <img src="news1.jpg" width="300" height="191"><br>
        Unfortunately, one of Dan&#8217;s Channel 7 News colleagues had his car 
        broken into just a few days after the report aired. Sorry to hear it, 
        but he should have paid more attention to the Channel 7 News.<br>
        <img src="news2.jpg" width="300" height="225"><br>
        Our very own <strong>Michael Strickland</strong> gives the perspective
        on crime of a resident of the neighborhood in his most recent, Civic
        Centric <a href="http://sfciviccenter.blogspot.com/2006/11/deputy-dawg.html" target="_blank">blog</a>.
        Coincidentally, Ulrica was hanging around outside Michael&#8217;s apartment
        a few days ago and fell into conversation with his car-broken-into-eleven-times
        neighbor, <strong>Holly</strong>. Apparently the inevitability of having
        her car broken into was less frightening to Holly than parking in Civic
        Center Garage and walking the two very scary blocks to her home at Franklin
        and McAllister after dark.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Laurel Winzler</strong>&#8217;s campaign to secure reserved parking
        for late-arriving Supers, however, seems to have been a success, with
        up to ten carpoolers reserving space for each <em>Carmen</em> and <em>Manon
        Lescaut</em> performance. Let&#8217;s hope Laurel&#8217;s efforts receive
        recognition at the 2007 Super Party Awards. We&#8217;ll never know how
        many broken windows -- or worse -- those efforts have saved.        <br>
      </font></p>
    </td>
    <td width="299" rowspan="2" valign="top" class="spearhead"> <p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2"><strong>Manon! Let&#8217;s Go!</strong><br>
        <br>
        A timely exit from an opera scene can often prevent a whole bunch of trouble 
        (just think of <em>La Forza Del Destino</em>) and &#8220;Manon! Let&#8217;s 
        go!&#8221; should have been Chevalier des Grieux&#8217;s insistence in 
        Act II of <em>Manon Lescaut</em>. It might have saved our heroine from 
        a lonely, lost, and abandoned fate in a very dry, pre-Katrina Louisiana. 
        However, if <strong>Karita Matilla</strong>&#8217;s magnificent Manon 
        Lescaut had left her Sugar Daddy&#8217;s house a few minutes earlier, 
        she wouldn&#8217;t have been exiled to the pre-Purchase state, and we 
        wouldn&#8217;t have been able to enjoy the best Super scene we&#8217;ve 
        seen in a long, long time &#8211; the roll call and branding of thirteen 
        prostitutes. It was the most compelling and disturbing scene in the show 
        thanks to the superb work of the Super women - and men - in the scene. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Each woman conveyed her own sense of dignity, sexuality, and degradation 
        and the brutal actions offset and complemented the impassioned, lyrical 
        duet between the principals going on at stage left. The direction of the 
        entire opera, by Oh-so-Euro debutant <strong>Olivier Tambosi</strong>, 
        was phenomenal, but this scene in particular left the strongest, most 
        lasting impression.<br>

        <strong>Bake Sale Madness<br>
        <br>
        </strong>The October 29th <em>Rigoletto</em> bake sale has been thusfar 
        unreported, due to Super documentarian Mike Harvey&#8217;s European <a href="http://web.mac.com/mikeharvey/iWeb/Site/UK%20-%20France.html" target="_blank">vacation</a>, 
        but it pulled in a princely $682. Ulrica was there with her Instamatic, 
        yet was seriously outshone by the wall-to-wall taffeta glamour and buxomness 
        of the <em>Rigoletto</em> ladies, with be-snooded gals Laurel Winzler, 
        Priscilla Lore and <strong>Pam De Weerd</strong> (below) looking strangely 
        like the <strong>Andrews Sisters</strong>, Patty, Laverne and Maxine. 
        Who would want to sit under the apple tree with anyone else but these?</font></p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0;"><font size="2"><br>
        <img src="DSCN0572-1.jpg" width="300" height="200"><br>
        The absolute scene stealer for that particular bake sale, however, was 
        <strong>Xander Patnoe</strong>, the little son of erstwhile Super <strong>Chris 
        Patnoe</strong> and his lovely, colorfully coiffed, make-up artiste wife, 
      <strong>Lisa</strong>.</font><font size="2"><br>

        <br>
        The December 3rd <em>Carmen</em> bake sale was a sold-out smash! The sale 
        attracted a huge crowd, and <img src="newpics/cakes.jpg" width="300" height="210" vspace="3">everything 
        went really early &#8211; in fact, we could have sold lots more goodies.

        A Holiday raffle (a tradition from earlier years revived this season)
         offered a beautiful freshwater pearl necklace, generously donated by
        Honorary 
        Super <strong>Denise Gutierrez</strong>, and two Holiday wreaths from
         Laurel Winzler. (<a href="../../events/2006bakesales/carmenbakesale/index.htm">photos</a>)<br>
        <img src="wreaths.jpg" width="300" height="236" vspace="3"><br>
        During a lull in ticket sales, Orchestra 'bone player <strong>Don Keneally</strong> 
        turned to the entire canteen and yelled &#8220;There are raffle tickets 
        for sale over here &#8211; what&#8217;s WRONG with you people???&#8221;, 
        garnering an immediate $50 increase in sales receipts &#8211; and a boost 
        in morale for the Orchestra members who took home two of the prizes. Other 
        winners included <strong>Jim Bowes</strong>, who wisely selected the stylish 
        Super tee-shirt, and chanteuse Claire Kelm, who received the fresh wreath, 
        <em>in absentia</em> (she was in her dressing room for a quick change 
        at the time). The raffle brought in a total of $170 to help replenish 
        the post-party Super coffers.<br>
        <br>
        My spies tell me that there is a movement afoot to discontinue the long-standing 
        tradition of fundraising bake sales, certain participants feeling that 
        the work is done by a few but the results enjoyed by all. Although that 
        seems, by nature, to be the case with most volunteer commitments, perhaps 
        Ulrica&#8217;s faithful readers would like to make New Year's resolutions 
        to contribute to one of the 2007 bake sales, dates TBA. Remember the cost 
        of your admission to the annual party covers less than half of the expenses.<br>

        My Sevillean spies report something more to add to the silence onstage 
        issue:</font></p>

        &quot;Two <em>Carmen</em> soldiers sweeping up the garrison were replaced 
        by chorus men after the Supers ad-libbed and laughed in character in Act 
        I. Someone unknown reported that the Super soldiers were making sounds 
        onstage and that this bit of acting should be done by union chorus members. 
        The Supers were removed from this bit of staging and chorus members took 
        their places.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"><br>
        Be that a warning to Supers to not vocalize in any way or you could lose 
        your stage time. <br>

        Spotted at a <a href="http://www.silentfilm.org/" target="_blank">San 
        Francisco Silent Film</a> event at the Castro this week: Super <strong>Jim 
        Dyvad</strong>, absent from the SFO stage for some seasons, but thriving 
        and busily pursuing his interest in European royalty, even meeting some 
        members of the Saxe-Coburg line on a recent visit to Germany and Denmark.<br>

        On the subject of Silent Film, no, this isn&#8217;t <strong>Lillian Gish</strong> 
        as filmed by <strong>DW Griffith</strong>, but our own Spearheader Lynn 
        Meinhardt, photographed by the similarly talented Mike Harvey.<br>
        <br>
        And what happened to scheduled first-night <em>Carmen</em> <strong>Marina 
        Domashenko</strong> and her last-minute replacement by Cast B star <strong>Hadar 
        Halevy</strong>? <em>Carmen</em> re-castings seem a part of SFO lore and 
        remind Ulrica of the abrupt departure of the scheduled maestro for the 
        1998 production, following a dispute over the amount of noise the cigarette 
        girls were allowed to make. She is reminded, too, of the 1991 outing of 
        the <strong>Jean-Pierre Ponelle</strong> production when a lame <strong>Marilyn 
        Horne</strong> was replaced by rising star <strong>Denyce Graves</strong>, 
        who then broke her ankle at the orchestra run-through but, wearing a cast 
        on her leg, gamely hopped off stage after freeing herself from Don Jose&#8217;s 
        ropes.<br>
        <br>
        Nice to see a very blonde <strong>Laurie Feldman</strong> <strong>Santoliquido</strong> 
        back on the SFO stage, directing, after triumphing for so many seasons 
        at the Met. Great to see production faves <strong>Sandra Bernhardt</strong> 
        assistant directing, and <strong>Mark Streshinsky</strong>, just back 
        from working in Los Angeles on <a href="http://www.losangelesopera.com/productions/manon.htm" target="_blank">the 
        other <em>Manon</em></a> with Russian diva Anna Netrebko.<br>
        <br>
        Supernumerary and thespian <strong>Grove Wiley</strong> is now branching 
        out into the Visual Arts, continuing his studies in painting. Just like 
        Rembrandt, his favorite subject is himself.<br>
        <img src="DSCN0559-1.jpg" width="300" height="225"><br>
        Glad to hear, too, that following the November 30th performance the &#8220;<em>Der 
        Barber von Bauhaus</em>&#8221; production was dismantled, ne&#8217;er 
        to be mantled again. It didn&#8217;t work for this viewer, and even less 
        the second time around. <em>Auf Wiedersehen</em> to the offstage manhole 
        cover, <em>Gute Nacht</em> to the dismantled Vespa.<br>
        <br>
        Ulrica found herself sitting behind our General Director at a final dress 
        a few days ago. Mr. G. is a very active listener, expressing more emotion 
        through gesture than even the opera&#8217;s leading lady.<br>

        Seems the <em>Chronicle</em> carries nothing but items of interest to
         Supers these days, the latest being news that <strong>John Else</strong>&#8217;s
          documentary  of the making of <strong>John
          Adams</strong>&#8217; and <strong>Peter
           Sellars</strong>&#8217; <em>Dr. Atomic</em> will be screened, out
           of competition,  at next year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/12/01/DDGBIMMBL61.DTL&hw=Jon%2BElse&sn=004&sc=732" target="_blank">Sundance
            Film Festival</a>, one of only two Bay Area productions thus honored
            (both,  coincidentally dealing with the atomic bomb). Ulrica wants <strong>Robert
             Redford</strong> to know that the acting contingent from Dr. A&#8217;s
              2006 debut will be happy to put in a collective personal appearance.
             You 
        only have to ask, Bob, and we&#8217;ll be there&#8230;<br>
        <br>
        Jon&#8217;s documentary <em>Wonders Are Many: The Making Of Dr. Atomic</em> 
        is slated to appear on PBS in 2008, and there is good reason to believe
         that said Supers will be glimpsed during some of the rehearsal footage. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Incidentally, Ulrica plans on attending a performance during <em>Dr. Atomic</em>&#8217;s 
        next US incarnation, at the <a href="http://www.lyricopera.org/" target="_blank">Lyric 
        Opera of Chicago</a> in early 2008. Anyone who cares to is welcome to 
        join the field trip for mid-winter fun in the Windy City.<br>
        <br>
        Speaking of Peter Sellars, John Adams, Pamela Rosenberg, and Leah Garchik, 
        all four come together in Ms. Garchik&#8217;s recent <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/11/21/DDGOULJAQK1.DTL&hw=manon%2Blescaut&sn=004&sc=136" target="_blank">item</a> 
        on the new Sellars/Adams collaboration in Vienna, <em>A Flowering Tree</em>. 
        Pamela was there for the premiere.<br>

        In a few short weeks, Ulrica will be flying off in the night to the Indonesian 
        islands of Bali and Java. No doubt a brand new obsession for gamelan and 
        Balinese dancing will keep her happy during the opera-starved winter and 
        spring. <img src="bali.jpg" width="300" height="222"></font></p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0;"><font size="2">But 
        in the meantime, she&#8217;s signing off for 2006 and wishing everyone
