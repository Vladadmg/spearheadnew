        BRODY knows the secret to getting a good view at the Metropolitan Opera 
        House. For the last 30 years, during his career as a supernumerary, or 
        extra, for operas and ballets at the Met, he has marched as a soldier 
        in &quot;War and Peace&quot; and transformed himself into a witch in &quot;Hansel 
        and Gretel.&quot; But in &quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; in which he usually 
        plays a butcher, his job afforded him the chance to see the performance 
        of a lifetime up close. It was Natalia Makarova's balcony scene in the 
        American Ballet Theater production of the full-evening dance.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">. 
        . .</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Bill 
        Leonard began working as a super in 1987 while training to be a ballet 
        dancer (he started too late), and though he never joined the corps of 
        Ballet Theater, he has found steady employment at the Met ever since. 
        &quot;There have been three artistic directors, and I'm still here,&quot; 
        he said with a grin. As a veteran super, he knows the ropes. &quot;The 
        one thing I always tell people is to make sure you go to the bathroom,&quot; 
        he said. &quot;You want to try to sit as much as you can before going 
        onstage — you do a lot of standing. And the lighting is intense, so you 
        need to hydrate yourself. If you don't follow those three rules, there's 
        going to be trouble.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">. 
        . .</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Filling 
        out the rest of the cast are guards, litter carriers, monks, a dozen elegant 
        men and women and two dead bodies. Danielle Ventimiglia, assistant stage 
        manager, is in charge of all of them, from the initial audition, in which 
        they stand nervously in front of a ballet master with numbers stuck to 
        their chests, to subsequent rehearsals and performances. </font></p>
      <p style="margin-top:0;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">One 
        doesn't sign up to be a super for the money — participants are paid $10 
        a rehearsal and $20 a performance. &quot;It ends up being more like a 
        travel reimbursement,&quot; Ms. Ventimiglia said. &quot;They do it because 
        they love the ballet, and the show would be so empty without them. They're 
        not scenery. They make a market scene come alive and a palace scene more 
        grandiose.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">But 
        even as simple as the job sounds, Mr. Brody says, prospective supers can't 
        just walk in off the street and expect to have the knack. &quot;I brought 
        someone in who just wasn't musical — he just didn't know where he was 
        onstage,&quot; he said. &quot;You have to have a sense of space and time. 
        It's a great responsibility.&quot; </font></p>
