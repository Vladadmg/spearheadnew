        - Griffin Cover</h5>
                  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Who would have thought that 
        it would be difficult to portray a Griffin? After all, no one knows how 
        the beast looked or moved&#8212;it's mythological. I thought this was 
        going to be a piece of cake. Ha! <a href="griffcovppic1.html"><img src="../images/Lynnpics/Griffin/1148110-R1-070-33A.jpg" width="253" height="162" hspace="6" vspace="6" border="0" align="left"></a>Try 
        donning the hindquarters of a lion costume, put seven-foot-high wings 
        and the head of an eagle on your back, and hold on to two-and-a-half-foot-long 
        inflexible front legs. This is what it takes to just put on the costume. 
        Sounds, uh, easy?</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;"><br>
        OK, crouch and squat. This is how the Griffin sits onstage. There&#8217;s 
        no need to go to the gym during a run of the <em>Flute</em>.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Now, to enter and exit the stage 
        you have to <em>hop</em>. This, according to the director, makes the Griffin 
        more interesting. But be careful, the head and wings can build up tremendous 
        momentum. If the head gets ahead of you, it will pull you over onto your 
        not-so-mythological face. Oh, and throughout the pageantry, you can't 
        see a thing. There is a section of mesh through which to view the stage. 
        Unfortunately, it is aligned with your nose, which means that you can 
        only see your feet; this doesn't help the Griffin navigate to the small 
        slot in the wings that constitutes an exit.<br>
        <br>
        My first time onstage as the Griffin was during a piano dress rehearsal. 
        I was so excited. This was my debut as the cover Griffin.</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
        I got into the costume. I was nervous. When I told the ASM that I hadn't 
        yet hopped in this thing, she looked at me calmly and said, &quot;So hop.&quot; 
        So I did. I didn't fall over. My fears were quelled.</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
        &quot;Griffin&#8212;Go.&quot; That was my cue, so I went.<a href="griffcovpic2.html"><img src="../images/Lynnpics/Groupings/1148110-R1-058-27A.jpg" width="320" height="228" hspace="6" vspace="6" border="0" align="right"></a> 
        I was a little uncomfortable squatting, but I did it. I heard all subsequent 
        cues and did my bit, with no major problems. Yippee! It was time to exit. 
        I went, and I didn&#8217;t run into the giraffe, which was another small 
        victory. I hopped to stage left. I couldn&#8217;t see anything. I kept 
        going, thinking, &quot;I wonder how many hops I need to take before I'm 
        sufficiently offstage.&quot; Then I heard a man say, &quot;Stop.&quot; 
        &quot;Hmmm . . . I wonder who he's talking to?&quot; I heard a scream. 
        It was high. It was loud.<em> It was the prima donna! </em>I had run into 
        her. My operatic life passed before my eyes. I could see the headline: 
        &quot;First Time Onstage . . . Last Time Onstage. Mythological Creature 
        Tramples Diva.&quot;</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><br>
        Well, I guess this is why they have rehearsals!</p></td>
