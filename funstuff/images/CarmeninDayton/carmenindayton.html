      <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Carmen in Dayton</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hello
            again, opera friends. I just finished my second experience with the
            Dayton Opera, a production of <em>Carmen</em> that was a hit with both the
          audience and
            local critics. My on-stage involvement was much less than my previous
            experiences in <em>Carmen</em> (thanks to a travel schedule that prevented
          me from being available for the early staging rehearsals), but I also
            had some new opportunities.<br>
            <br>
        Last spring, I was asked to update and expand the roster of Supers,
            so I spent some time during the summer contacting everyone on the
            current
          roster, as well as trying to make new connections through local theater
          groups. I was able to find only a couple new people, but was at least
            able to identify those who were still interested in being Supers.
            I also gained
          a better perspective on what Carrie has to go through, although she
            seems to have much more success than I had.<img src="Carmen3.jpg" width="250" height="169" align="right"><br>
            <br>
            Thanks to my periodic involvement as Production Super Captain in
            SF, I was also asked to serve in a similar capacity for the <em>Carmen</em> production.
          I think it was a new experience for the production staff, so they did
          not
          provide as much information about rehearsal changes as I would like
          to have relayed to the Supers. However, I at least took some of the
          burden
          off the very busy Stage Manager (whose duties seem to include the normal
          Stage Management stuff, as well as Artistic Coordinator and Super Captain
          functions).<br>
          <br>
        This is the third production of <em>Carmen</em> done by Dayton Opera, and the
          first two are referred to as &quot;Sexy&quot; Carmen and &quot;Choking&quot; Carmen.
          The first is self-explanatory. The second was the result of Don Jose
          losing his knife in Act 4, and deciding that strangulation was a suitable
          alternative
          when the score called for Carmen's demise. Unfortunately, he got a little
          carried away, and Carmen came off stage coughing and gagging (although
          she recovered in time for the next performance).<br>
          <br>
        This production included former SF Adler Fellow <strong>Elena Bocharova</strong> as
          Carmen, a role which she has also sung with New York City Opera, and
          it was fun
          to hear the role sung by a rich mezzo voice. Elena is obviously very
          comfortable in the role, as she was able to instantly incorporate an
          on-stage miscue
          into her character on opening night (a water barrel was tipped over
          just before her entrance from the cigarette factory), by splashing
          petulantly
          through the unexpected pool of water.<br>
          <br>
        Don Jose was sung by <strong>Thomas Rolf Truhitte</strong>, a tenor who generally sings
          Wagnerian roles, and thus brought a more powerful voice to the role
          than is typical. Thomas came up through Opera San Jose, and has performed
          with
          Seattle Opera. Escamillo was sung by <strong>Carlos Archuletta</strong>, with most of
          the smaller role handled by recent graduates of the <a href="http://www.ccm.uc.edu/faculty/facultyProfile.aspx?facultyid=68" target="_blank">Cincinnati
          Conservatory of Music</a> (where <strong>Sandy Bernhard</strong> is currently in charge).<br> 
        <br>
        My favorite singer was <strong>Megan Monaghan</strong> as Micaela. She has been described
          as having a &#8220;voice of pure silver,&#8221; and she recently sang the
          role of Gilda in <em>Rigoletto</em>, so it was almost a bit of luxury casting to
          have her sing such a relatively small role in Carmen. <img src="Carmen2.jpg" width="250" height="169" vspace="4" align="left">I was her Guide in
          Act 3, so I was able to listen to that aria from close range. She was also
          very approachable and easy to work with, which are traits I&#8217;ve
          noticed in all the young singers used by Dayton Opera.<br>
          <br>
        The Stage Director was <strong>Michael McConnell</strong>, who also directed the production
          of <em>Tosca</em> shortly after I moved to Dayton this year. Mike is very detail
          oriented, and he makes it a point to give everyone on stage something
          to do. Unfortunately, there is very little rehearsal time for most
          productions,
          so things always seem a bit ragged up until the final dress rehearsals.
          Everyone was kept almost an hour past the scheduled end of the first
          on-stage rehearsal (no union rules here), for the copious notes (or
          belated initial
          staging) that Mike wanted to give.<br>
          <br>
        The chorus (about 36 people for Carmen, plus the kids) was given special
          attention in the local paper prior to opening night, with a lengthy
          article on their commitment. These people are recruited from all over
          the Dayton
          area, and as far away as Cincinnati. They all have full time day jobs,
          since they are paid barely more (about $400) than Supers in SF would
          receive for an entire production. They begin their rehearsals a month
          before anyone
          else, but the process seems to place most of the burden on them to
          learn the music in time (they are mailed a synopsis, copies of their
          section
          of the score, and a cassette tape that includes a pronunciation guide
          and recoding of their parts). In spite of these limitations, they consistently
          produce a wonderful sound on stage.<br>
          <br>
        The Supers are apparently not held in the same high regard, or even
          recognized by the press as legitimate components of an opera. The same
          article mentioned
          that &#8220;13 additional people filling non-vocal roles&#8221; were
          involved in Carmen. At least the term &#8220;stage vermin&#8221; has
          not yet reached this area. <br>
          <br>
          <img src="Carmenhorses.jpg" width="250" height="188" align="right">This was also my first production in which animals were included (not
          counting the small dogs and various human-costumed creatures I saw
          in SF). Three
          horses were part of the Act 4 parade, with costumed, professional handlers
          riding them on-stage. As the Mayor (who made an entrance at the end
          of the parade), I had to be extra careful in finding a route across
          the stage.
          Seems like we could have cast at least a couple <em>Chulos</em>.<br>
          <br>
        Another new experience was the chance to mingle with the audience prior
          to curtain. The production team decided to have several Act 4 Supers
          (in their colorful and tight-fitting costumes) to welcome the patrons
          to Seville
          in the lobby. We even had some of the mounted horsemen out on the sidewalk
          (I guess road apples are OK on stage, but not in the lobby). As PSC,
          my primary duty was to make sure the Matadors stopped acting out in
          time to
          get into their Act 1 costumes, but I also decided to use the opportunity
          to wear my tux (along with some Mayoral accessories) for the first
          time since I moved to Dayton.<br> 
        <br>
        I almost had a minor Hammy moment during the last performance. I joined
          Micaela on the backstage stairs for our entrance, and she asked if
          I had always worn my glasses for that scene. She said they looked fine
          with the
          costume, but I'm glad I had an opportunity to get rid of them. It made
          me long for the codpiece I wore in <em>Simon Boccenegra</em>, which was a convenient
          place to store such items.<br>
          <br>
        Our next productions will be <em>Cenerentola</em> and <em>Die Fledermaus</em>,
        neither of which will require many Supers, but I hope that the company
        will
          want my
        services as liaison again. <br>
