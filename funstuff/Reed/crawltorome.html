        <h1 align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0"><strong><em>Crawling to Rome</em></strong></h1>
        <p align="center" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">        A review of <em>Tannh&auml;user</em> by chorister Tom Reed</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong><img src="images/dd_tann02.jpg" width="200" height="183" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="right"> Act I</strong><br>
  In a time when painful pilgrimages were about the only fun to be had, it is no wonder that a town like Venusberg would become a tourist hotspot. Known for its loose ladies of highly flexible morals, it was conveniently located in a disreputable region&nbsp;just off&nbsp;the Thuringian pilgrims&rsquo; route&nbsp;between the towns of&nbsp;Taltitz and Plauen. There&nbsp;it siphoned off much of the religious&nbsp;pilgrim trade originally headed for Rome by promising to put the evil back in medieval. Tannh&auml;user is a frequent customer, who has&nbsp;gotten bored&nbsp;playing &ldquo;catch the naughty nun&rdquo; with the local trollops. He&rsquo;s heard about a singing contest at some club in Wartburg and decides to give it a try.<br>
        <br>
        On his way to Wartburg he encounters a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;male penitents slowly crawling&nbsp;their way to Rome to receive absolution. Carved into their backs with thick red syrup are their individual sins. (I&nbsp;asked that my sin be&nbsp;&ldquo;BURGER KING,&rdquo; but that has too many letters, so we compromised and made it&nbsp;&ldquo;HATE.&rdquo;&nbsp;When I cover the&nbsp;&ldquo;H&rdquo; with my costume,&nbsp;it appropriately&nbsp;reads:&nbsp;&ldquo;ATE.&rdquo;) Unfortunately the <img src="images/TannPilg.jpg" width="150" height="227" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="left">quick-drying syrup tends to stick to the costume, which then pulls and&nbsp;tugs painfully. Think of this <em>Tannh&auml;user</em> run&nbsp;as a twenty-four-day back waxing,&nbsp;one hair at a time. It takes the pained penitents&nbsp;almost three minutes just to crawl the 64 feet from stage right to stage left. If you factor in the mandatory fifteen-minute breaks, that&rsquo;s just&nbsp;947 feet per hour. At this rate, the 632 mile trip by knee from Wartburg to Rome will take 32 weeks, 4 days, 6 hours and 28&nbsp;minutes, give or take the Alps. And that&rsquo;s just one way. Think of the overtime!<br>
        <br>
        They invite&nbsp;Tannh&auml;user to crawl along, but&nbsp;he isn&rsquo;t about to join the chorus when there are even bigger bucks&nbsp;to be made as a soloist in Wartburg. Instead, he&nbsp;heads off&nbsp;to the audition as the&nbsp;distant voices of the&nbsp;penitents are heard&nbsp;fading toward the basement showers, where they wash away their sins, wearing bathing caps thoughtfully provided by the wig department.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Act II</strong><br>
        Wartburg&rsquo;s nobility&nbsp;is all pumped over the big singing competition at the glorious Hall of Song hosted by Prince Hermann. As they arrive, the guests are greeted&nbsp;by Hermann&rsquo;s daughter Elisabeth,&nbsp;whose enthusiastic pleasantries seem&nbsp;rather forced. And no wonder. What a dump! There&rsquo;s evidence of a fire, the&nbsp;roof has big holes, the soggy floor is&nbsp;rotten and overgrown with weeds, and most of the seating is on&nbsp;narrow, slanted&nbsp;benches. Clearly the rumors that the place had been a whorehouse in Act I were true. But couldn&rsquo;t the cheapskate Prince&nbsp;have&nbsp;slapped on a coat of paint? Or at least cut down the&nbsp;huge tree sprouting in the middle of the&nbsp;room! Poor Elisabeth!! For her sake&nbsp;the&nbsp;stunned guests&nbsp;do their best to&nbsp;appear&nbsp;delighted to be there.<br>
        <br>
        Given the filthy surroundings, the ladies immediately&nbsp;regret their decision to come&nbsp;dressed as May Queen Madonnas in white gowns&nbsp;with blue veils. Yet they&nbsp;smile stoically through the squalor, gazing&nbsp;ever heavenward with fixed serenity&mdash;a&nbsp;posture more or less mandated&nbsp;by the tug of their floor-length veils as they attempt to back their butts&nbsp;up onto the&nbsp;crooked benches to sit down. The men&nbsp;glance about the hall&nbsp;in search of something&mdash;anything&mdash;to compliment. All lift their voices in the&nbsp;exuberant refrain, &ldquo;<em>Freudig begr&uuml;&szlig;en wir die edle Halle / wo Kunst und Frieden immer nur verweil</em>.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Joyfully we greet this old Hall where sluts and libertines&nbsp;used to&nbsp;hang out.&rdquo;) They marvel at the architecture. &ldquo;<em>Wo lange noch der Ruf erschalle.</em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;How long the roof has lasted!&rdquo;) No one mentions the tree. At last their song culminates in a great round of&nbsp;praise&nbsp;for their august host: &ldquo;<em>Th&uuml;ringens F&uuml;rsten, Landgraf Hermann, Heil!!</em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Hail to Thuringia&rsquo;s first slumlord!&rdquo;)<br>
        <br>
        <img src="images/TannElis.jpg" width="200" height="193" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="right">Hermann kicks off the song&nbsp;contest with a long-winded speech. Internationally renowned director Graham Vick has carefully coached the chorus on the subtleties of Hermann&rsquo;s speech, providing a word-for-word translation so that each&nbsp;chorister&nbsp;may&nbsp;create his or her own individualized responses based on a&nbsp;thorough understanding of the text. For example,&nbsp;Hermann&rsquo;s line, &ldquo;<em>Wenn unser Schwert in blutig ernstern K&auml;mpfen / stritt f&uuml;r des deutschen Reiches Majest&auml;t ,/ wenn wir dem grimmen Welfen widerstanden / &nbsp;und dem verderbenvollen Zwiespalt wehrten: / so ward von euch&nbsp;nicht minder Preis errungen!</em>&rdquo; means, &ldquo;LOOK PROUD!&rdquo;<br>
        <br>
        Hermann announces that his daughter, Elisabeth, will present the winner with the grand prize, which just&nbsp;happens to be herself. Well, jaws just hit the floor! 
No one knew the Prince was so cheap as to give away his own daughter in a&nbsp;tacky   song contest, rather than shell out a few lousy&nbsp;pfennigs for a proper prize!" <br>
        <br>
        While Elisabeth struggles to hide her total shock and humiliation, a contestant by the name of Wolfram&nbsp;tries to restore some sense of&nbsp;decorum by singing&nbsp;about family values. But nervous Tannh&auml;user keeps&nbsp;thinking it&rsquo;s his turn, and repeatedly interrupts&nbsp;with his&nbsp;song, a smutty&nbsp;little number&nbsp;he learned on one of his debauched &ldquo;<em>hohen Fest</em>s&rdquo; in Venusberg. Well, in a repressed town like&nbsp;Wartburg, that&rsquo;s all it takes. The guys get turned on and start jumping the ladies. Then a brawl breaks out. In the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e someone sets fire to the big&nbsp;tree that everyone&rsquo;s been trying so hard not to notice. Poor Elisabeth! This was supposed to be the&nbsp;highbrow event&nbsp;of the year! Well, that&rsquo;s it! She&nbsp;flips out and starts telling everyone off in no uncertain terms. The shocked guests come back to their senses, and soon&nbsp;everyone wishes they&rsquo;d just&nbsp;stayed home. The Prince blames the whole thing on Tannh&auml;user and orders him to&nbsp;catch the next pilgrimage to Rome, or else!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Act III</strong><br>
        Elisabeth just can&rsquo;t shake the blahs. She&rsquo;s&nbsp;still hanging around the old Hall reliving&nbsp;her humiliating song-competition&nbsp;fiasco when the penitents from Act I come bursting&nbsp;back in from Rome, grinning from ear to ear&nbsp;like naughty boys who skipped Lent and went straight for their Easter baskets. Just what she needs: another mob scene! But it&rsquo;s obvious from all the arm waving and hallelujahs that they&rsquo;ve got something shameful&nbsp;to hide. How can they have been to Rome and back in less than three hours? Clearly they&nbsp;decided to forgo Rome and take a&nbsp;&rdquo;layover&rdquo; in Venusberg instead. Those conservatives, I tell you!<br>
        <br>
        Convinced that everyone has swallowed their phony absolution story, they head for home with a lot more spring in their step, leaving Elisabeth feeling more depressed than ever. <img src="reedpics/whackamole.jpg" width="250" height="220" align="right">In&nbsp;a clumsy&nbsp;attempt to&nbsp;snap her out of it,&nbsp;Wolfram snaps her&nbsp;neck by mistake. What a <em>putz</em>! Then while she&nbsp;drifts off to heaven,&nbsp;he tries to ease his guilty conscience by singing some&nbsp;sappy ditty about the joys of&nbsp;floating past&nbsp;Venus in the&nbsp;afterlife. Tannh&auml;user shows up, babbling something about the Pope&rsquo;s staff&nbsp;denying&nbsp;him absolution. Too bad. He could really use it right&nbsp;now, as he, too, is&nbsp;about to&nbsp;blast off and&nbsp;join the late Elisabeth out there in space.<br>
        <br>
        Just then,&nbsp;a sudden rainstorm&nbsp;drives the pilgrims back inside, but the leaky roof provides no protection at all. As the opera concludes in&nbsp;a&nbsp;deluge,&nbsp;the mysterious source of all those fires is at last&nbsp;revealed, as&nbsp;dozens of&nbsp;homeless urchins come popping up out of the flooded floor like an impromptu&nbsp;Whack-a-Mole convention. But by this point&nbsp;nobody cares what&rsquo;s happening on stage&nbsp;because the music is&nbsp;just so&nbsp;damned&nbsp;gorgeous!</p>
