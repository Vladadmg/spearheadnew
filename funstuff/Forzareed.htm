        <em>Act I Scene 1 - </em></font><em><font size="2">In the household of 
        the Marchese of Calatrava</font></em><font size="2"><br>
        <br>
        Leonora has been dating Don Alvaro, but her father, the Marchese, says 
        he's not going to let his daughter marry a lowlife. Alvaro shows up intending 
        to elope with her, and it all goes well, except for one little glitch 
        when he accidentally shoots Leonora's father dead.<br>
        <br>
        <em>Scene 2 - An inn, Hornacuelos, Spain</em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">On 
        the lam disguised as travelers, Alvaro and Leonora are greeted by the 
        local chorus. By the time Verdi wrote <em>Forza</em>, Italian audiences 
        were getting really good at following his convoluted plots, so this time 
        Verdi decided to trip them up by introducing the concept of multiple personality 
        disorder.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Apparently 
        quite accustomed to multiple personalities, the choristers greet the guests 
        by singing &quot;hello&quot; not once, but dozens of times. Everyone sits 
        down to dinner. Don Carlo is there, but he is no longer Leonora's brother. 
        He is now Pereda, a student searching for the killer of Carlo's father. 
        This might seem odd, but in a town where villagers happily dine on bowls 
        of imaginary soup, anything goes. <img src="/funstuff/images/ForzaOpening.jpg" width="350" height="269">Suddenly the fortune teller Preziosilla, 
        who is dressed as a lobster, jumps up on the table and announces that 
        war has broken out. Overjoyed, the townsfolk can't wait to try out their 
        new machine guns - very advanced weaponry for the mid-1800s. The revelry 
        is interrupted by the arrival of pilgrims stumbling blindly across the 
        oddly slanted stage<br>
        with bags over their heads, dragging huge crosses and light sabers. Under 
        the cover of some gratuitous religious music, choristers collect the disoriented 
        penitents and point the poor souls back to their dressing rooms. The merriment 
        resumes with Pereda telling the story of his entire life. It takes just 
        two minutes. As the villagers pretend to understand whatever it is he's 
        babbling about, Preziosilla begins to suspect that he might be another 
        multiple. Finally the Alcade sends everyone home, touching off another 
        long round of hellos and goodbyes.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"><em>Scene 
        3 - A monastery</em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Leonora 
        joins the monastery and becomes a man<br>
        <br>
        <em>Act II - In the woods somewhere, several years later</em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Things 
        get really busy. Alvaro has become Don Federico Herreros, a war hero. 
        But he remains in love with Leonora whom he thinks is still a woman, but 
        dead. Pereda, who bears a striking resemblance to Carlo, has dropped<br>
        out of school and become Don Felice de Bornos, whose life Federico has 
        just saved. The two men (actually five) swear eternal friendship (Herreros 
        and Bornos, not Pereda and Carlo, and definitely not Carlo and Alvaro!) 
        Herreros is severely wounded and begs Don Felice not to open a<br>
        box containing his personal items. So of course Felice opens it immediately. 
        Well, technically it was Pereda who opened Federico's box, but let's not 
        get overly analytical. Anyway, discovering a picture of Leonora he decides 
        to murder Herreros as soon as he is well enough to die.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">While 
        the soldiers are busy discovering the technical wonders of the flashlight, 
        Vargas tells Alvaro that Leonora is still alive. He (Herreros) can't wait 
        to go search for her (him), but Don Felice (Carlo) calls Herreros (Federico) 
        a lowlife, which of course sets Alvaro off again. Federico and Felice 
        duel, but the ever helpful chorus takes time out from a torturous costume 
        change to interrupt the duel, and so<br>
        Federico (Alvaro) and Alvaro (Alvaro) decide to become a monk.</font></p>

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;"><font size="2">Trabuco, the mule 
        driver from Act One, is now a thief, but his new name is the same as the 
        old one. Well, it happens sometimes. Anyway, while he robs everyone blind, 
        topless chorus sluts entertain the troops, and lobster lady Preziosilla 
        goes about telling fortunes. It all proves too much for Friar Melitone 
        who launches into a sermon about moral fiber. The soldiers try to convince 
        him that the chorus boobs are all fake, but he flips out, provoking a 
        fight between the men, while the women can only think about getting back 
        downstairs and out of those gawdawful mammosuits. Preziosilla saves the 
        day by leading the chorus in a rousing military gibberish march, climaxing 
        with the long overdue nuclear flash from<em> Doctor Atomic</em>.<br>
        </font><font size="2"><br>
        <em>Act III Scene 1 - At the monastery of the Madonna degli Angeli, Hornacuelos, 
        Spain<br>
        </em><br>
        Friar Melitone, still obsessed with fiber, is serving the starving peasants 
        bowls of hot confetti. Alvaro / Federico has become a saintly monk by 
        the name of Padre Rafael. Don Felice shows up at the monastery and accuses 
        Rafael of being the lowlife who murdered Carlo's father. This of course 
        reawakens his Alvaro personality and leads to yet another duel between 
        the two (Carlo/Felice vs. Alvaro and Federico/Rafael).<br>
        <br>
        <em>Scene 2 - Nearby</em><br>
        <br>
        Leonora can't understand why becoming a male hermit hasn't made her happy. 
        Could it be that spending years moping about a cave is maybe just a touch 
        depressing? No, that can't be it. She must still be in love with Alvaro. 
        Just when she decides it's time to die, guess who shows up for a visit. 
        It's that saintly Padre Rafael! And he's dragging along Don Felice whom 
        he's just stabbed! <br>
        <br>
        Wait a minute! Felice/ Bornos/ Vargas/ Carlo/ Pereda, and Federico/ Herreros/ 
        Rafael/ Alvaro???? Jeez, this hermitage is turning into Grand Central 
        Station! Padre Rafael begs the holy hermit (Leonora) to pray for Felice. 
        So let's see. Her estranged lover who killed her father is now the saintly 
        monk who stabbed her brother. No problem at all! But the dying Carlo is 
        freaked that he now has a brother instead of a sister, so he stabs her 
        (him/her). Well, those were not very enlightened times. And Alvaro, the 
        cause of this whole mess? Leonora forgives him just before she too kicks 
        off. Now, you gotta admit, that's grand opera!</font></p>
