      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ulrica 
        sees a curious correlation between Grand Opera and silent movies. No doubt 
        her many years of experience as a Supernumerary have created a bond with 
        the voiceless performers of the Silent Age. So imagine her delight when 
        she received the program for the Eighth Annual Silent Film Festival at 
        the Castro Theatre earlier this month and saw the 1915 Cecil B. De Mille 
        film of <em>Carmen </em> listed, starring handsome morphine addict Wallace 
        Reid and the Metropolitan Opera's Golden Age star, the lovely Geraldine 
        Farrar (above). Ulrica well remembers her own days as a ‘Gerry Flapper' 
        screaming with delight whenever Madame Farrar took the stage, especially 
        in those long neglected <em>verismo </em>roles for which she was so renowned: 
        Zaza, Louise, The Goose Girl, Madame Sans Gene. The list goes on.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So it was definitely a trip
          down memory lane to hear the Mighty Wurlitzer pounding out selections
          from Bizet and to see ‘Gerry' dancing ecstatically
        on the tables, rose clenched firmly between her teeth.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As we all know La Farrar had a tumultuous career in love, including
        paramours Arturo Toscanini and the Crown Prince of Germany. When the
        Crown Prince's father politely asked Gerry to leave both his son and
        his country at once, she did so, taking with her several pieces from
        the German crown jewels. Ulrica strongly recommends Gerry's autobiography <em>Such
        Sweet Compulsion </em> written in 1938 and co-authored with the spirit
        of her already deceased mother. Fascinating reading!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And speaking of the Silent Age, Super <strong>Lisa Lorea </strong>(unlike
        your correspondent, much too young to remember that era first hand) comes
        from a long line of silent movie actors. Her great-uncle, Delos Hammers,
        was a Keystone Kop (pictured center in the convict's striped hat, below)
        and her grandmother, silent player Hazel Bailes, appeared in D.W. Griffith's
        1916 classic <em>Intolerance, </em> befriending cinema great Lillian
        Gish on the set. Lisa herself was recently seen moving across the raked
        SFO stage on her knees while precariously placing votive candles during
        the finale of <em>The Damnation of Faust.</em></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And who was the wag who renamed that opera <em>101 Damnations? </em></font></p>

        <p style="margin-top: 0;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Have you ever wondered where our opening night
          candies and rubber-stamped cards come from? Well, the candies come
          from choclatier Joseph Schmidt via <strong>Charlie Lichtman</strong> but
          the cards are hand-crafted by Super<strong> Renee DeJarnatt</strong> with
          a great deal&nbsp;of wit and patience. Renee has been doing them longer
          than anyone can remember but on behalf of all of us, Ulrica would like
          to say a big <font color="#FF0000">Thank You to Renee</font> for all
          of her hard work, show after show. Renee was at the Super Call with
          her delightful granddaughter, would-be Super Dominique and hopes to
          be back in the House with us soon. </font></p>

            Into</font></strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ulrica drove to the new International Terminal at San Francisco Airport
        today to meet dear friends arriving from London. She was amazed to see
        Maestro <strong>Donald Runnicles </strong>coming through the gate, pushing
        his own luggage cart! Ever one to lend a hand she rushed towards him,
        only to see Maestro's familiar shock of gray curls quickly disappearing
        into the crowd. Uncharitable readers may want to make a connection between
        Ulrica's presence and Maestro's hasty retreat but one prefers to believe
        he was just very anxious to return home to his lovely wife, former Super <strong>Elizabeth</strong> ( <em>Don

        Carlo </em> 1992) and daughter, <em>Damnation </em>Super <strong>Ashley</strong>. </font></p>
      <div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also spotted by your ever vigilant correpondent, this time on Hayes
        Street, looking at bottles of wine in Amphora, superstar soprano <strong>Ruth
        Ann Swenson</strong> and husband ex-chorister&nbsp;<strong>David Burnakus</strong>.
        As this was the&nbsp;evening of the Super Call, Ulrica was afraid that
        sorely-missed Ruth Ann&nbsp;might be having to&nbsp;audition as an SFO&nbsp;Super
        but then happily remembered that she will be performing in concert at
        the newly restored Napa Valley Opera House on August 15th.&nbsp; </font></div>
