        The Dragon - Mike Harvey</h5>
                  <p>There was a discussion about the dragon 
        costume before I was allowed to get into or under it. Wardrobe discussed 
        whether or not they should add foam to the interior so that the old beast 
        would rest on the shoulders of the Super handler rather than on his head. 
        Finally, I got under it and the Prop team lowered away.<a href="dragonpic1.html"><img src="../images/Lynnpics/Dragon/1148110-R1-065-31.jpg" width="147" height="223" hspace="6" vspace="6" border="0" align="left"></a></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Being inside is like being in 
        the driver's seat of a crazy machine designed by Hieronymus Bosch. In 
        spite of the foam, most of the weight is borne on the head. There is a 
        bit of mesh that affords a distorted view of a one-foot-square area, four 
        feet straight ahead. The old beast's lolling head and gaping maw rests 
        way out in front of the Super on creaky casters. <a href="dragonpic2.html"><img src="../images/Lynnpics/Dragon/1146450-R1-047-22.jpg" width="205" height="135" hspace="6" vspace="6" border="0" align="right"></a>Inside 
        the neck is a large, heavy CO2 fire extinguisher that emits scary bursts 
        of dragon snot.</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;"> <br>
        At the first stage rehearsal, I was asked to ride the trap without the 
        dragon suit while it was lowered below the stage. I was given the go-ahead 
        to step on the two-foot-square plywood panel, and at the cue, down I went. 
        I was astonished to find a team of stagehands below, lowering this contraption 
        by hand with a rope and pulley. There were no electronically controlled 
        elevators in sight. The trap is a platform lowered hand-over-hand by a 
        group of guys who have your life, or at least your brittle bones, in their 
        capable hands.<br>
        <br>
        The dragon is a very special creature in that he is part costume, <a href="dragonpic3.html"><img src="../images/Lynnpics/Dragon/1148110-R1-031-14.jpg" width="277" height="198" hspace="6" vspace="6" border="0" align="left"></a>a 
        scaly rubber padded suit and Godzilla feet, and part prop, the large body 
        construction that includes the head, wings, and tail. The Wardrobe Department 
        is responsible for the padded suit and feet, the Prop Department takes 
        care of the body, and the Electrical Department is responsible for the 
        fire extinguisher inside the body. So there's a real feeling of an Apollo 
        mission coming together while we wait for the overture to finish, the 
        curtain to rise, and ASM to cue the entrance.<br>
        To complicate matters, Tamino shoots a real arrow at the offstage dragon, 
        so it was decided at the last minute that everybody backstage should avoid 
        puncture wounds by standing behind a curtain, well away from the dragon&#8217;s 
        empty prop body. This leaves barely enough time for Props to rush in, 
        hoist the dragon, and remove the brace; Electrical to reach in and pull 
        the pin on the CO2; Props to lower the beast onto Godzilla's shoulders; 
        the assistant to yell &quot;Go!&quot;; and the dragon to lumber onstage 
        toward Tamino.</p>
      <p>Where the hell is the trap? 
        It's dark and I can't see a thing. <a href="dragonpic4.html"><img src="../images/Lynnpics/Dragon/deaddragon.jpg" width="158" height="237" hspace="6" vspace="6" border="0" align="right"></a>I 
        try to remember to pull the trigger for smoke at the right times and to 
        paw the ground menacingly, but my main goal is to hit the trap. If I don&#8217;t, 
        I&#8217;ll be stuck onstage under Puff for thirty-seven minutes. I make 
        my way stage left, spewing as I go, and I see a slight variation in the 
        floor&#8212;I hope it's the trap. I can hear someone say offstage, &quot;He's 
        on,&quot; as the Queen of the Night&#8217;s lovely ladies run at me shaking 
        spears. Then down I go, after one last pull on the smoke handle, into 
        a warm seething pit of steam-enhanced dry ice vapor that feels like the 
        Great Dismal Swamp. I&#8217;m in total oblivion; I can't see anything 
        at all. The stagehand assigned to spot me calls out, &quot;Where is he?&quot; 
        I stagger out of the gloom as the smoke clears, and I can see that the 
        trap has already risen. Stray dragon parts have not followed me into the 
        hole.<br>
        <br>
        Mission accomplished.</p>
