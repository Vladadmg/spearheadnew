        <font size="2">After starving herself throughout the Teutonic austerity 
        of the Rosenberg Administration, <strong>U!</strong>lrica finds herself 
        ready to binge on the glamour of the new Gockley Era, which got off to 
        a sparkling start Friday night with the season opener, <em><a href="http://www.sfopera.com/opera.asp?o=239" target="_blank">Un 
        Ballo in Maschera</a></em>.<br>
        <br>
        Events like this only reconfirm that, of all the groups that comprise 
        the San Francisco Opera (from stars to security), the Supernumeraries 
        are, without a doubt, the hottest. Our vocal prowess may not be remarkable, 
        nor our histrionic abilities Academy Award&#8211;winning, but we really, 

        really know how to look good. <br>
        <img src="images/biggroup3.jpg" width="300" height="500" vspace="4"><br>
        There are, however, times, when the most conspicuously glamorous can be 
        truly incognito. My spy, <strong>Twisted Sister</strong>, reports:<br>
        <br>
        <em>I was standing inside the stage door to keep warm while watching the 
        swells arrive, and I was joined by an older Guild volunteer, who chatted 
        away about this and that. After while, a third lady took up a post next 
        to us to check out the gowns &#8212; none other than <strong>Debbie Voigt,</strong> 
        in khaki crops, a pullover, clogs and NO makeup. We joked about her being 
        a &quot;stealth diva&quot; and how she could sneak out into the crowd 
        and be completely ignored by the people who'd be cheering her several 
        hours hence. The old Guild dame wasn't tracking the conversation too well, 
        because at some point she rather grandly said to Debbie, &quot;And what 
        do you do for the Opera, dear?&quot; Debbie replied &quot;I'm your diva 
        tonight&quot; and the volunteer replied, &quot;Very funny, but really, 
        what do you do around here?&quot; Debbie was completely nonplussed, so 
        I jumped in and said &quot;She's not kidding &#8212; she is our star for 
        tonight. Haven't you met Miss Voigt?&quot; and the Guild lady looked like 
        she would drop dead of astonishment. In the tent after dinner, Debbie 
        &#8212; by now resplendent in a green satin gown that was truly diva-worthy 
        &#8212; laughed and said &quot;You should go get your friend and ask her 
        if she recognizes me NOW!&quot;.</em> <br>
        <br>
        Thank goodness she has a great sense of humor..... I can think of some 
        old-time divas who'd have chewed that woman's head off!!!!!<br>
        <br>
        Then there are those who will always be glamorous despite what Wigs and 
        Wardrobe do to them. Take, for example, three of the loveliest fishwives 
        ever to grace the War Memorial stage: <em>Ballo</em> Supers (L to R) <strong>Yvette 
        Forte Rosedale, Traude Albert</strong>, and<strong> Katerina Rubin</strong>. 
        Even babushkas shall not their beauty diminish. <br>
        <br>
        <img src="images/fishwife.jpg" width="300" height="132"><br>
        <br>
        As gorgeous as all the Supers were, <strong>U!</strong> has to admit that 
        (L to R, below) directrix <strong>Gina Lapinski</strong>, maestri <strong>Armiliato</strong> 
        and <strong>Runnicles</strong>, and backstage carpenter<strong> Randy 
        Walsh</strong> were looking pretty good, too.<br>
        <br>
        <img src="images/maestri.jpg" width="300" height="117"> <br>
        Being a pre-set Super on Opening Night gives one a rare chance to be able 
        to sing (in a fashion) on the Opera House stage &#8212; as long as you 
        know the words to the <em>Star Spangled Banner</em>, that is (and this 
        columnist, being of foreign descent still has trouble wrapping her tongue 
        around them). Other Supers &quot;happened to find themselves&quot; downstage 
        right, where Debbie Voigt and<strong> Anna Cristy</strong> were singing 
        out from behind the Stage Manager's console. The pre-overture onstage 
        buzz reminded chorister <strong>Tom Reed</strong> of the Adler years and 
        how the Great Man would come around at moments like that scolding &#8220;Not 
        zo loud, pleeeze. Ze curtain eez SOOO thin!&#8221;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><img src="images/adler_k_02.jpg" width="300" height="269" vspace="3"> 
        <br>
        Any gripes this column has had in the past were forgiven upon seeing
        the  tribute to the late <strong><a href="../../committee/memorial.html">Katherine
         Brazaitis</a></strong> on <a href="images/brasaitisballo-prog.jpg">page
        12</a> of the <em>Ballo</em> program, and the 
        acknowledgment, on page 65, of a donation in Katherine&#8217;s name made
         by Super <strong>Susan Anderson</strong> <strong>Norby</strong> and her husband, <strong>Doug</strong>.
          Katherine would be amused, I&#8217;m sure, to find herself sharing
          a page  with the great Marschallin, <strong>Dame Elisabeth Schwarzkopf</strong>.</font></p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2"><em>Ballo</em> Supers&#8217; Opening
          Night treats were augmented by lovely handwritten notes from incoming
          Super Coordinator <strong>April Busch</strong> (below 
        left). Although it was a much appreciated gesture, April, we&#8217;ll
        understand if writer's cramp kicks in and you have to resort to a rubber-stamped
        message by the time <em>Carmen</em> comes around. And speaking of rubber 
        stamps, cheers to <strong>Renee de Jarnatt</strong> for doing the witty
        First Night cards once again. Openings just wouldn&#8217;t be the same
      without them.</font><font size="2"><img src="images/stillife.jpg" width="300" height="640" vspace="3"><br>

        morning found <strong>U!</strong> with a Glamour Hangover &#8212; a result 
        of the cumulative effect of fumes from so many French fragrances, the 
        repetitive glare of flash reflected off real, but rented, rocks, the lingering 
        lilt of languid laughter, and the intoxication of a billion bursting champagne 
        bubbles.<br>
        <br>
        Barely able to go through her morning ablutions, <strong>U!</strong> declined 
        to attend Orlofsky&#8217;s Ball that evening. Our man on the <em>Fledermaus</em> 
        scene, <strong>Charlie Lichtman</strong>, reports:<br>
        <br>
        <em>The only not-really-unexpected thing that happened during </em>Fledermaus<em> 
        was that the dogs got applause when Prince Orlofsky trotted them out in 
        the second act. We continue to marvel at the sophistication (or perhaps 
        the indiscreet charm) of the San Francisco Opera audience.</em><br>
        <br>
        Dogs, or any other animal, on stage always reminds <strong>U!</strong> 
        of the production of <em>Suor Angelica</em> a few seasons ago, which involved 
        an onstage donkey who, on at least one occasion, refused to leave the 
        stage and got a conspicuous erection when his nun-attendant tried to drag 
        him off. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>U!</strong> wisely waited until Sunday to re-appear, heavily veiled, 
        at Opera in the Park. Supers, though sadly absent from the stage, were 
        visible throughout the crowd. <strong>Kimberly Thompson</strong> and <strong>Walt 
        Thorpe</strong> &#8212; one in floor-length black satin and a mantilla, 
        the other in figure-hugging BDUs and a chic new (black) SFO tee &#8212; 
        were out pushing subscription brochures.</font></p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"><font size="1">(BDU 
        = Battle Dress Uniform, a.k.a. camouflage)</font><br>
        <br>
        <em>Spearhead</em>-er <strong>Lynn Meinhardt</strong>, and boyfriend <strong>Sheldon</strong> 
        hung out with fellow Supes Charlie Lichtman and <strong>Andrew Korniej</strong> 
        &#8212; who was shamelessly trying to seduce April with home-made chocolate 
        cake in a misguided attempt to get better roles next season.</font></p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"><br>
        <img src="images/oitp2.jpg" width="300" height="843" vspace="3"><br>
        The concert was, as always, delightful, with forthcoming SFO <a href="http://www.sfopera.com/opera.asp?o=241" target="_blank">Gilda</a> 
        (and former Queen of the Night) <strong>Mary Dunleavy</strong> truly outstanding 
        in &quot;Cara Nome&quot; and the &quot;Libiamo&quot; finale. <strong>U!</strong> 
        is baffled why this extraordinary singer isn&#8217;t more <em>feted</em> 
        than she is; her SFO <em>Traviatas</em> of recent seasons bringing to 
        mind the divine <strong>Claudia Muzio</strong>. <br>
        <br>
        <em><a href="http://www.sfopera.com/opera.asp?o=240" target="_blank">Fledermaus</a></em> 
        was amply represented throughout the concert, with arias about laughter 
        and champagne conspiring to remind <strong>U!</strong> of Opening Night&#8217;s 
        excesses, and thereby bringing on another wave of nausea. Our Rosalinda, 
        <strong>Christine Goerke</strong>, sang a thrilling &quot;Dich, teure 
        Halle,&quot; whilst General Director <strong>David Gockley</strong> (in 
        an &quot;&#8216;orange is the new black&quot; baseball cap) let slip that 
        <em>Tannh&auml;user</em> and <em>Andrea Chenier</em> are on the books 
        for future seasons, meaning, of course, lots of Super ops in both. Who 
        can forget 1994&#8217;s triple-X antics during the opening scenes of the 
        former, or the parade of dignitaries, sans-culottes, and condemned women 
        of the 1992 production of the latter.<br>
        <br>
        The MC, <em>Chronicle</em> editor <strong>Phil Bronstein</strong>, went 
        slightly astray with his jokes about the taut faces of some of Opening 
        Night&#8217;s leading benefactors, right before introducing two of them, 
        and Mr. Gockley seemed genuinely overcome by the enthusiasm of the huge 
        crowd. <br>
        <br>
        One passing thought: why hasn&#8217;t <em>Die Fledermaus</em> suffered 
        the indignities of a translated title &agrave; la<strong> </strong>&#8220;A 
        Masked Ball&#8221; or &#8220;The Force of Destiny&#8221;? Perhaps &#8220;The 
        Bat&#8221; sounds somewhat less appealing than the title <em>auf Deutsch.</em></font></p>
      <hr>
      <font size="2">All this talk of <strong>Bradly Hamilton</strong> moving
          to Vermont has Supers speculating that he will be starting a Bohemian
          Grove&#8211;type
          retreat for us every summer. <strong>U!</strong>, however, was hoping
          for something more like the Vermont Home for Retired Supernumeraries,
          where one might be put out to pasture when even the slowest moving
          lackey
          is beyond one&#8217;s capabilities. Below is a photo from a recent
          VHRSOpera production of <em>Arshak III </em>featuring an all-Super
          cast.</font>

      <br>
      The charming <strong>Jessica Wan</strong> (below, left) of the SFO Marketing
       Department met with a group of Supers (including <strong>Jim Bowes</strong>,
        center, and <strong>Gilbert Martinez</strong>, right. and below left
        to right, Kimberly Thompson, Traude Albert, Bradly Hamilton, <strong>Rob
        Wonder</strong>,
        <strong>Tom Carlisle</strong>, and <strong>Andrew Melomet</strong>) last
        week to get a feel for what it is, exactly, that we do. They
      tried their best to explain. <img src="images/interview3.jpg" width="300" height="243" vspace="3">The interview is for the September issue of
      the Opera E-Newsletter so keep
      an eye open for it (if you don't already subscribe, <a href="http://sfopera.com/eopera.asp" target="_blank">here's
       the link</a>). We&#8217;ve been promised a link from the E-Newsletter
       to 
      <em>The Spearhead</em>, so who knows who will be wandering through these
       pages.<br>
Suggestions to remove unflattering content about SFO would, I&#8217;m afraid,
result in the excision of the entire Ulrica <em>oeuvre</em>, which some may not
regard as a bad thing.<br>
      <br>
      The <a href="http://www.sfpalm.org/" target="_blank">Performing Arts Library 
      and Museum</a>, meanwhile, was only able to offer us &#8220;a tiny little 
      corner of a lobby exhibit &#8211; not large enough for a scrapbook,&#8221; 
      which is quite in keeping with our level of expectation.</font> 
      <hr>      
      <font size="2">Finally, here&#8217;s a tout for the 
      soon-to-be-available, soon-to-be-a-collectible, hot-off-the-presses, gold-on-black
      Super Logo Tee Shirt. <img src="images/tshirt.jpg" width="300" height="242"></font>The
      shirt has our beloved <em>Non Solum Hastas</em> logo possibly making its final appearance
      and will be on sale at the September 17th <em>Ballo</em> bake sale for a mere $17
      (S, M, L, XL), or by mail for an extra $4. Just <a href="mailto:Akorniej@yahoo.com">email</a> to order one.
