      <p><font size="2">Nerves were strained and tensions ran high as we gathered for the fall
                  season audition on Friday, August 5. For many it was like a class reunion,
                  or an annual family gathering, or perhaps one of those <strong>Sun Myung
                  Moon</strong>        mass weddings.<br>
        <br>
        We strutted our stuff in front of our fellow Supers and those sweet and
                  cuddly assistant directors and directors who, in previous auditions,
                  have kept us standing around for hours, only to decide later that we&#8217;re
                  not the right &#8220;type.&#8221;<br>
        <br>
        We missed that whole new crop of 18&#8211;30 year olds who would compete
                  for a small walk-on role in this season&#8217;s stunner, <em>Doctor Atomic</em>.
                  Maybe they had something else to do in their lives for three months,
                  or perhaps they needed to pay the rent.<br>
        <br>
        The women spent endless hours working out with the new &#8220;Suzanne
                  Sommers Breast Blaster&#8221; in preparation for baring their lovely
                  bosoms in <em>La Forza del Destino</em>, as witnessed by <strong>Susan
                  Anderson Norby</strong>        and her band of Mammary Maidens.<br>
        <br>
        The testosterone level soared as our usual group of talented Supers nearly
                  scratched each other&#8217;s eyes out in order to play one of those 20&#8211;35
                  year old &#8220;muscular but not necessarily body builder&#8221; characters
                  in <em>Norma</em>. <br>
        <br>
        We watched as two assistant directors fought to the death over which
                  one would have us in their production, where we will be dressed in trench
                  coat and fedora with our backs to the audience, upstage, in complete
                  darkness, behind a scrim.<br>
        <br>
        It was clear that Supers heeded the warning to get to the gym in preparation
                  for a role as one of the guys in <em>L&#8217;Italiana in Algeri</em> who are &#8220;capable
                  of carrying things on and off stage,&#8221; or as the mean-yet-funny
                  Vlad, complete with his enormous tool. And who could resist wearing one
                  of those &#8220;cool&#8221; animal costumes for two performances a day
                  in <em>The Magic Flute</em> in front of an audience of screaming children?<br>
        <br>
        So now we wait. Will I get a call? Should I check my email every hour
                  on the hour? Did I overact that little exercise, or was I just a bit
                  over-the-top? The dust is settling and egos are healing. It&#8217;s just
      another day in the life of a Super.</font></p>
