        <p><font size="2"><strong>Would
        you like to do extra work on the movie RENT?</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left">Beau Bonneau Casting is casting extras for RENT, the
          feature film based on the Broadway hit musical. RENT is being directed
          by Christopher Columbus,and stars Taye Diggs, Rosario Dawson and Jesse
          L. Martin. Filming begins later this month in the Bay Area and will
          last through June 2005! 
          Non Union Extra work pays $68 for up to 8hrs
          plus overtime thereafter. There will more than likely be overtime as
          film shoots are long, often lasting 12 hours or more. *If selected
          as an Extra With Car, there is an additional $35 for your vehicle.
          These are standard film extra rates set by production, not by Beau
        Bonneau Casting.<br>
        <br>
          We have an immediate need for the following types: ARTISTS, BOHEMIANS,
          MUSICIANS, STREET PEOPLE, JUNKIES, DRUG DEALERS, PIMPS &amp; STREET

        Beau Bonneau Casting highly encourages the following types to come in
        ASAP:<br>
        <br>
        ARTIST, BOHEMIAN &amp; MUSICIAN TYPES: Men &amp; Women, all ethnicities,
        18-35, in shape, with an edge or interesting look for various scenes
        set in New York City during the late 1980's. Think the Ramones, Clash,
        Velvet Underground; we're looking for retro, early underground, alternative-punk
        types, barely making the rent in the East Village. If you have a car
        that is from 1975-early 90's that is a plus (and you can earn a little
        extra $$$$).<br>
        <br>
        STREET PEOPLE, JUNKIES, DRUG DEALERS, PIMPS AND STREET WALKER TYPES:
        Men and Women, ALL ethnicities, 21-50s with interesting, character looks
        for various scenes set in New York City during the late 1980's.<br>
        <br>
        GENERAL EXTRAS WITH CARS: Men and Women, all types and ethnicities, 18
        to 65 years. We may need YOU or JUST YOUR CAR. Your vehicle must be manufactured
        1975-early 90s. Car must be in decent condition, run well, and quietly.
        You must have a valid driver's license, and a clean driving record. NO
        RED, NO WHITE, &amp; NO CONVERTIBLES will be considered. (Again keep
        in mind the film is set for the late 80's. If you have a newer make/model
        of car it may not be appropriate.)<br>
        <br>
        If you fit the description, come in to our office at your earliest convenience,
        Monday - Friday 1:00PM - 5:30PM and DROP OFF the following:<br>
        One or two recent color photo(s) with First &amp; Last Name, 2 Contact
        Phone Numbers &amp; an Email address on the back of each photo. NOTE:
        Your photos Will Not Be Returned! IF YOU HAVE AN APPROPRIATE CAR, please
        submit one photo of your car only.<br>
        <br>
        Beau Bonneau Casting is located at 84 1st Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.<br>
        We are very close to Mission St. (Kitty-corner from the Transbay Bus
        Terminal &amp; 1
        block from Montgomery Bart Station). No appointment is necessary, however
        you must come in between the times given.<br>
        <br>
        ***If Beau Bonneau Casting feels you may be appropriate for a particular
        role, we may ask to take digital photos of you or possibly cast you on
        the spot (which is why we ask you to come in to our office!) and you
        will be in the SF Casting database free for the duration of the film
        (the film will shoot through the month of June).<br>
        <br>
        Please note that attending registration, or dropping off photos does
        not guarantee employment. We are casting specific types and will contact
        you only if selected.        </p>
