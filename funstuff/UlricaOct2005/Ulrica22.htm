        Now that Opening Night is over, the creative process of staging the opera 
        is finished for now, and <a href="../../images/Atomicpics/atomicreview.html">the 
        reviews are in</a> (showing, predictably, that the greater the newspaper 
        the better the review &#8211; bouquets for the <em>New York Times</em>, 
        rotten vegetables to the <em>Sacramento Bee</em>) here are a few declassified 
        documents of our own; vignettes from the production of <em>Dr. Atomic</em> 
        with its many ups and just a few downs. <br>
        <br>
        &#8226; The goofy exercises AD <strong>Kathleen Belcher</strong> put us 
        through at the Atomic audition in July: &#8220;introduce yourself, round-robin 
        style, with an adjective starting with the same letter of the alphabet 
        as your first name and with an appropriate action.&#8221;<br>
        <br>
        &#8226; The thrill at being accepted for the production and the daunting 
        task of rearranging one's schedule for 30 rehearsals over the following 
        eight weeks and bidding a fond <em>adieu</em> to any social life. <br>
        <br>
        &#8226; The first Super Rehearsal when we all showed up and spent an hour 
        and a half completely engrossed by <strong>Peter Sellars</strong>&#8217; 
        intimate descriptions of the creation of the opera and of the forces at 
        play in Los Alamos in 1945.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"><img src="/funstuff/UlricaOct2005/sellars1.jpg" width="300" height="303"> 
        <br>
        &#8226; Rehearsal interchange. Peter Sellars: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want 
        to end the opera with a mushroom cloud.&#8221; Super: &#8220;They have 
        one in <em>Forza</em>.&#8221; Peter Sellars: &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you 
        told me. I was just about to say there&#8217;s one in every cheesy rock 
        video&#8221;.<br>
        <br>
        &#8226; The library of books on J. Robert Oppenheime<strong>r</strong> 
        and Trinity in the orchestra pit at Zellerbach A, and the DVD handout 
        by filmmaker <strong>Jon Else</strong> of his documentary <em>The Day 
        After Trinity</em>. All of these became very important in helping us immerse 
        ourselves in the background and complexities of the subject; we are all 
        suddenly authorities on nuclear fission.<br>
        <br>
        &#8226; Peter Sellars&#8217; many, many hugs and his repeated, rhetorical 
        &#8220;Is that cool?&#8221;<br>
        <br>
        &#8226; Certified Circus Clown <strong>Jeremy Vik</strong>&#8217;s handstands.<br>
        <br>
        &#8226; Rehearsing one evening upstairs in the chorus room, with the chorus, 
        dancers and directorial team going through the incredible Vishnu Chorus.<br>
        <br>
        &#8226; Catty chorine to no one in particular (but well within earshot of many
        of us) &quot;I thought the Supers were supposed to be all the way upstage...&quot;        <br>
        <br>
        &#8226; The incredible energy, precision and consistency of the well utilized 
        Atomic Dancers, who are always an inspiration to watch (and to hear when 
        they slide to the ground at the end of their final dance).<br>
        <br>
        &#8226; The cheerful and welcome presence of Jon Else and his documentary 
        film crew throughout the rehearsal period. The documentary will end where 
        the performances begin, meaning that the last shot filmed would be Peter 
        Sellars going onstage for his curtain call at the end of final dress and 
        seeing <strong>John Adams </strong>leaving through a back door of the 
        auditorium. <br>

&#8226; Chatting with one of the principals and discussing Peter&#8217;s 
        reluctance and superstitions about staging the final scene until the
last possible moment, and the awe at watching it unfold from first Zellerbach
rehearsal until Opening Night.</font></p>

        &#8226; The graciousness of tenor <strong>Tom Randle</strong> when Peter 
        Sellars made the announcement that they were looking for a different vocal 
        texture for the role of <strong>Robert Wilson</strong> and that he was 
        being replaced.<br>
        <br>
        &#8226; New Wilson tenor<strong>Tom Glenn</strong>&#8217;s endearing nervousness 
        at every rehearsal.<br>
        <br>
        &#8226; The first hearing of the orchestral percussion that propels the 
        Vishnu Chorus.<br>
        <br>
        &#8226; The tension following veiled threats to remove Supers from Vishnu 
        if we didn&#8217;t &#8220;get it&#8221; (we did get it, thanks to the 
        intervention of the indefatigable <strong>Larry Pech</strong>).<br>
        <br>
        &#8226; The sadness and dismay we felt at the replacement of <strong>Al 
        Heiben</strong> as Lt. Bush the day before final dress; wondering if, 
        despite all the talk of being an integral part of the project, we weren&#8217;t 
        somewhat disposable after all. <br>
        <br>

          onstage, but perhaps feels differently about them when not.<br>

        <strong>Phil Pickens</strong>. Downstairs in the lounge, our spies caught 
        one lady from Wigs and Makeup surreptitiously opening the box to one of 
        the cakes and, when she thought no one was looking, cutting herself a 
        corner piece before the intermission cake-cutting ceremony (shame!).<br>

        <br>
        &#8226; Pamela&#8217;s eloquent cast party tributes to the people who
