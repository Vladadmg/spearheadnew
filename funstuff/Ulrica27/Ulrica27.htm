      <p style="margin-top: 0;"><font size="2">Ulrica was delighted 
        to find, in her Yahoo Mail Inbox, an SF Opera announce</font><font size="2">ment 
        of a <a href="http://fest07.sffs.org/films/film_details.php?id=121" target="_blank">screening</a> 
        of the <a href="http://www.itvs.org/pressroom/pressRelease.htm?pressId=348" target="_blank">documentary</a> 
        <em>Wonders Are Many: The Making of </em>Doctor Atomic (2007) at the fabulous 
        Castro Theater on Saturday, April 28th, as part of the <a href="http://fest07.sffs.org/" target="_blank">San 
        Francisco International Film Festival</a>; with an additional screening 
        at the Pacific Film Archive in Berkeley on April 30th.<br>
        <br>
        As devoted readers of <em>The Spearhead </em>will remember, Wonders was 
        <a href="http://spearheadnews.com/funstuff/Atomic/jonelse.html">filmed</a> 
        during the rehearsals for <strong>John Adams</strong> and <strong>Peter 
        Sellars</strong>&#8217; masterful <em>Doctor Atomic</em> during the 2005 
        season. <em>Spearhead-</em>liner <strong>Lynn Meinhardt</strong> has been 
        tracking the film's progress from the filmmakers' initial press release 
        to its <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wonders_are_many/" target="_blank">successful 
        world premiere</a> at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival.<br>
        <br>
        Super Acting Contingent appearances notwithstanding, the film has a magnificent 
        pedigree: filmmaker <strong>Jon Else</strong>&#8217;s <em>oeuvre</em> 
        includes <em>The Day After Trinity: Oppenheimer and the Atomic Bomb</em> 
        (1980), detailing many of the events covered in the <em>Atomic</em> libretto, 
        and <em>Sing Faster: The Stagehand's Ring Cycle</em> (1999) set backstage 
        during the 1990 SF Opera production of Wagner's <em>Ring</em>. Lynn and 
        fellow WAC <strong>Yvette Forte Rosedale</strong> were prominently featured 
        in one of the official publicity shots for the film, which augurs well 
        for Super appearances within the film.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><img src="images/atomiclynn.jpg" width="300" height="150"><br>
        The <em>Atomic</em> future includes revivals in Amsterdam, Chicago, the 
        English National Opera in London and, reportedly, the Metropolitan Opera. 
        <em>Wonders Are Many</em> is scheduled for a PBS airing at some undetermined 
        time in the future, but who wouldn&#8217;t rather see Supers in WWII drag 
        up on the big screen?<br>
        <br>
        The winter months are usually an operatic desert here in San Francisco, 
        but fortuitously the SF Symphony mounted the U.S. premiere, in March, 
        of the latest Adams/Sellars opus, <em><a href="http://www.playbillarts.com/news/article/5593.html" target="_blank">A 
        Flowering Tree</a></em>, and, of course, Ulrica was there. In direct contrast 
        to the broad scope and doom-laden drama of <em>Dr. Atomic</em>, <em>A 
        Flowering Tree</em> provided, through a retelling of an ancient Indian 
        fairy tale, a message of<a href="http://www.playbillarts.com/news/article/5593.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/tree.jpg" width="300" height="134" border="0"></a> 
        redemption and forgiveness, performed by three singers (including <em>Dr. 
        A</em>&#8217;s <strong>Eric Owens</strong>), three renowned Javanese dancers, 
        and the massive voice of the SFSymphony chorus, whose members wore brightly 
        colored shirts -- at the suggestion, we suspect, of Peter Sellars himself.<br>
        <br>
        Further drama occurred when Ulrica's elevator car was disturbingly rocked 
        during intermission. The cause? Not deteriorating conditions at Davis 
        Hall as Ulrica supposed, but a minor earthquake.<br>
        <br>
        Unexpected cultural combinations are to be expected in Peter&#8217;s productions. 
        In this case, we saw an Indian folktale set to contemporary American music 
        influenced by Grand Opera (Ulrica heard references to <em>Das Rheingold</em> 
        and <em>Turandot</em>), Indonesian gamelan orchestras with Javanese ballet 
        dancers (one of whom performed on <strong>Madonna</strong>&#8217;s last 
        tour), and choral singing in Spanish because the chorus for the original 
        Viennese production happened to be Venezuelan. Oh, boy. It was an enchanting 
        evening and one hopes that it will return some day for more than the three 
        performances offered this time.<br>
        <br>
        Spotted in the lobby was Symphony Chorus husband, Super, and <a href="http://communications.fullerton.edu/fsc/bios.html#top" target="_blank">Pulitzer 
        Prize</a></font><font size="2">-winning photographer <strong>Ron Mann 
        </strong>(below). Ron&#8217;s wife Melody sings with the SFS. Ron is almost 
        always Super-cast against type as a menacing heavy (most notably Vlad 
        the Impaler in the 2005 season opener, <em>L&#8217;Italiana in Algeri</em>), 
        when really he is one of the nicest guys you could meet.<img src="images/ronmann.jpg" width="300" height="199"></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>The Ulrica Archipelago</strong><br>
        The slow, hypnotic movements of the Javanese dancers and the rhythmic
             chiming of the gamelan transported Ulrica back to her recent Asian
            adventure; 
        two weeks on the islands of Bali and Java. The nation of Indonesia is
             a huge string of 1700 islands stretching from Malaysia to Australia
            and 
        has been subjected to innumerable disasters, natural and man-made, over
             the past few years, including the 2004 <a href="http://www.ess.washington.edu/tsunami/Sumatra.htm" target="_blank">tsunami</a> 
        in Sumatra, a major <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_2006_Java_earthquake" target="_blank">earthquake</a> 
        in May &#8216;06, terrorist bombings in Bali, an unparalleled <a href="http://www.bioedonline.org/news/news.cfm?art=2755" target="_blank">environmental
         disaster</a> in NW Java, ferry boat <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/12/31/world/main2318300.shtml" target="_blank">sinkings</a> 
        and mysterious airplane <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/JAK73802.htm" target="_blank">disappearances</a>.
        As a result tourism to the country has fallen off drastically but it
        is
        a vast country offering a rich and exotic experience.<br>
        <br>
        <a href="images/ricepaddies_1.jpg"><img src="images/ricepaddies.jpg" width="300" height="225" border="0"></a>During 
        the course of this all-too-brief visit, Ulrica toured rice paddies, marveled 
        at the tenth-century ruins of <a href="images/Prambanan63_1.jpg" target="_blank">Prambanan</a> 
        and <a href="images/borobodur_1.jpg" target="_blank">Borodobur</a>, was 
        enraptured by the Ramayan Ballet, ignored Avian Flu warnings to explore 
        the <a href="images/birdmarket47_1.jpg" target="_blank">bird markets</a> 
        of Yogyakarta, purchased dozens of ikats and batiks (they will eventually 
        find homes on the walls of Peet&#8217;s Coffee stores) and fell in love 
        with the landscape and the people. However the trip was not without its 
        dangers&#8230;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>On the Rocks</strong><img src="images/Birdman.jpg" width="300" height="225"><br>
        Ulrica&#8217;s very own Indonesian Disaster came about during an ill-advised 
        attempt at snorkeling off the <a href="images/B0000021_1.jpg" target="_blank">North 
        Coast</a> of Bali. Strong currents and a complete disregard of the dive 
        master&#8217;s advice combined to cause Aquatic Ulrica to lose her way 
        and be washed ashore on the coral reef, causing, with knees, elbows, and 
        flippers, untold damage to the delicate eco-structure of the region.<br>
<br>
        Uncharitable voices might suggest that Ulrica was washed up a long time 
        ago, but her desperate attempts to right herself and recover dignity were 
        the stuff from which <em>opera buffa</em> is made.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>Around the World in 80 Ways</strong><br>
        Ulrica&#8217;s brush with death in Bali was as nothing compared to the 
        intrepid travels of canoodling Super Emeritus <strong>Bradly Hamilton</strong>. 
        Bradly and his partner Thom are midway through a world tour and, when 
        last heard from, were in Christchurch, NZ heading towards Japan. Prior 
        emails described cruising Tierra Del Fuego, a stop at the Falkland Islands, 
        and a breathtaking flight to Antarctica.<br>
<br>
        <em>&#8220;We arrived in Punta Arenas where I took a three-and-a-half 
        hour plane ride to Antarctica. It was the most beautiful place I have 
        ever seen and am truly blessed that I was there. I saw ring neck penguins, 
        gentoo penguins, Antarctic fur seals, and humpback whales. Although it 
        was sunny, the wind would whip up and it was cold at some points of the 
        tour&#8230; I really can&#8217;t describe in words how spectacular Antarctica 
        is.&#8221;</em><img src="images/iceberg.jpg" width="300" height="214"><br>
<br>
        Of special interest to my dear readers would have been an &#8220;hilarious&#8221; 
        performance of <em>Aida</em> that Bradly attended in Buenos Aires.<font size="1"><br>
<br>
</font></font><font size="2"><img src="images/teatro.jpg" width="300" height="225"><br>
        <em>&quot;Before the curtain rises, Supers are stationed throughout the 
        house in full Egyptian garb posing like British Royal guards not allowed 
        to look or move. The principals came out belting every word and the more 
        they screeched, the better the crowd roar. The entire chorus stared out 
        into the crowd making eye contact with everyone as if it were a recital 
        and they were not part of a story at all. Best yet, however, during the 
        triumphal march the Supers and chorus came down the aisles of the orchestra 
        passing out stale crusts of bread to the audience with naked painted ladies 
        in the worst 'Cats Musical' make-up. Members of the audience actually 
        ate the damn bread. At intermission, I thought a martini would be more 
        fun than a second act, and left.&quot;</em></font><br>

        </font>As we all know, even without stale bread and naked ladies, that 
        Triumphal March can be an obstacle course of embarrassing anachronisms, 
        substandard synchronization, wardrobe malfunctions, and other misadventures. 
        Once again, Ulrica is reminded that the benchmark of a true Super is that 
        he or she has never seen a Triumphal March &#8211; he or she has always 
        been marching in it.</p>
            <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0;"><font size="2"><strong>Ballet 
        Boys</strong><br>
        Over lunch at Chow last week, <strong>Eddy Gordillo</strong> described 
        his stint supering in the SF Ballet&#8217;s recent production of Tchaikovsky&#8217;s 
        <em>Sleeping Beauty</em> (yawn&#8230;.). Supers of Character were gathered 
        for the opening Royal Court scenes; their &quot;character&quot; <em>contra 
        punto</em> to the youthful vigor of the Ballet School students...<br>
        <img src="images/eddy.jpg" width="300" height="356"><br>
        Another participant in that production was <strong>Dan Melia</strong>; 
        undoubtedly our community&#8217;s brainiest member (Dan has appeared on, 
        and excelled at, TV&#8217;s smart quiz show <a href="http://spearheadnews.com/OutoftheBox3.html" target="_blank">Jeopardy</a>). 
        March 17th also saw Dan on local television providing background info 
        on that day&#8217;s Saint Patrick. Dan is a Professor of Celtic History 
        at UC Berkeley and was able to enlighten stay-at-home celebrants on the 
        historic, snake-repelling St Patrick. Now if only someone would explain 
        to Ulrica the phenomenon of people of all ethnicities wearing &#8220;Kiss 
        Me I&#8217;m Irish&#8221; buttons and Leprechaun hats&#8230;<img src="images/dan.jpg" width="300" height="110"><br>
        <br>
        Long since consigned to the compost bin but still very much alive in Ulrica&#8217;s 
        memory is the striking floral arrangement by our own <strong>Laurel Winzler</strong> 
        that was on exhibition at the De Young Museum as part of its annual &quot;Bouquets 
        to Art&quot; exhibition last month. <strong><img src="images/bouquets07_005.jpg" width="300" height="260"></strong>Laurel&#8217;s 
        floral sculpture was inspired by, and outshone I might add, a green and 
        silver Venetian glass piece by Seattle master <strong><a href="http://www.chihuly.com/" target="_blank">Dale 
        Chihuly</a></strong>. <br>
        <br>
        Never forget that the Super Committee is always working tirelessly on 
        our behalf. Their selfless <a href="http://spearheadnews.com/committee/Scharffen%20Berger%20tour/scharffenberger.html" target="_blank">expedition</a> 
        to the Scharffen Berger chocolate factory shows how far they will go to 
        provide leadership to the Super corps and maintain discipline among Supers 
        as warranted. </font></p>
            <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"><strong>Ruth 
        Ann vs The Met</strong><img src="images/Swen2650.jpg" width="300" height="200"><br>
        Looks like the Met is at it again &#8211; soprano abuse that is. Following 
        celebrated &quot;firings&quot; of superstars <strong>Kathleen Battle</strong>, 
        <strong>Angela Ghiorgiou</strong> (&#8220;that wig goes on with or without 
        you&#8221;), and <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mooTbjsMEaY" target="_blank">Maria 
        Callas</a></strong></font><font size="2">,<strong> </strong>it now looks 
        as though SFO favorite <strong>Ruth Ann Swenson</strong> is getting similarly 
        shabby treatment (<em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/05/arts/music/05ruth.html" target="_blank">NYTime</a></em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/05/arts/music/05ruth.html">s 
        article</a>) &#8211; and at a time of great personal struggle, too. Ruth 
        Ann is recovering from surgery and chemotherapy for breast cancer and, 
        regardless, deserves better than to be replaced by <strong>Ren&eacute;e 
        Fleming</strong> - she of the endless <em>legato</em> and reckless <em>rubato</em> 
        - whose <em>Rusalka</em> second act remains, IMHO, her greatest achievement. 
        States Met GM <strong>Peter Gelb</strong>, &#8220;any day that we can 
        get Ren&eacute;e Fleming is a good day for the Met.&quot; Ulrica has to 
        concede that the Met does need every good day it can lay its hands on. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The Met is damn lucky to have Ruth Ann singing Cleopatra to <strong>David 
        Daniels</strong>&#8217; Giulio Cesare this month (it will be broadcast 
        live on April 21st). Ruth Ann&#8217;s 2002 SFO appearances in the role 
        were not only radiantly sung but, as always, exhibiting elusive qualities 
        that her competition seems to so completely lack: wit and charm.<br>
        <br>
        I&#8217;m sure the SFO Supers join me in wishing Ruth Ann a quick and 
        complete recovery. We can only imagine the reception she&#8217;ll receive 
        when she returns to San Francisco in 2008 for another Handel role in a 
        luxuriously cast <em>Ariodante</em> (<strong>Susan Graham</strong> and 
        powerhouse contralto<strong> Ewa Podles</strong> will co-star). <br>
        <br>
        An anonymous observer reports seeing Peter Gelb recently on <em>Charlie 
        Rose</em>. He came across as a typical populist impresario and more or 
        less said that he wanted to replace older and fatter singers with younger 
        and prettier ones in order to attract new audiences and &quot;reinvent&quot; 
        opera.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Glamour, Glamour, Toujours Glamour</strong><br>
        <img src="images/dessay2.jpg" width="300" height="206">The Season of Glamour 
        will be here before we know it &#8220;so glamorous that it needs two galas,&#8221; 
        but IMHO Glamour has always been in season. Ulrica throws her arms open 
        to welcome long overdue debutants, <em>petite belle chanteuse</em> <strong>Natalie 
        Dessay</strong> (above) and raven-haired <strong>Angela Ghiorgiou </strong>(below), 
        and is a-quiver with anticipation about seeing <em>La Rondine</em> and 
        the new Phillip Glass work on the stage of the War Memorial.<img src="images/georghiu.jpg" width="300" height="211"><br>
        <br>
        <em>The Little Prince</em> and a reprise (presumably sans <strong>Pamela 
        Rosenberg</strong> as a tree, below) of <em>Flute for Kids</em> are all 
        well and good but once again our efforts to find new audiences ignore 
        one whole sector of the opera-going public, the decrepit Opera Queen. 
        <img src="images/pamela.jpg" width="300" height="208">Ulrica would like 
        to advocate special performances, with AARP discounts, of <em>Flute for 
        the Forgetful</em> &#8211; the Queen of the Night aria repeated over and 
        over and over again; <em>Flute for the Incontinent</em> &#8211; lots of 
        very short acts with many brief intermissions; and possibly <em>Flute 
        for the Flatulent</em> &#8211; outdoor performances only.<br>
        <br>
        If you want to hear the sound of Super feet rushing the SF Opera stage, 
        tune in to the series of broadcasts of performances from the past two 
        seasons coming up on <a href="http://www.kdfc.com/pages/297676.php" target="_blank">KDFC 
        Radio</a>. The series began this past Sunday with the broadcast of last 
        year&#8217;s Super-intensive <em>Manon Lescaut</em>. Ulrica can&#8217;t 
        say for sure, but she thinks she heard a Chorus Lady&#8217;s scream during 
        the whore-branding scene.<br>

        told there is no truth whatsoever to the rumor that Supers will be coming 
        under the jurisdiction of Janitorial in a new SFO departmental shuffle.

        Doubts have been expressed regarding the authenticity of <a href="images/memo.jpg">this</a> 
        document, purportedly found in a recycling bin on Franklin Street and 
        dated April 1st, which recently came into Ulrica&#8217;s possession but 
        her sources are working (<em>Nessun Dorma</em>!) to verify its authenticity.</font></p>

        Grab your brooms. It promises to be a Season of Glamour for all but we
