      <p><font size="2"><strong>Super Party, X-Dressers 
        and People in Black</strong></font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Ulrica has emerged, 
        once again, from another period of solitary contemplation. While there 
        are still those who believe Ulrica might want to spend much more time 
        in quiet seclusion they have, thus far, refrained from saying so to her 
        face. So, partner in hand, she swept into the always fabulous <em>scena</em> 
        that is any- gathering of the San Francisco Opera Supers.<br>
        <br>
        A good portion of attendees had heeded the call to dress up in costume; 
        most notably the lovely <strong>Katherine Braizaitis</strong> as either 
        a Nutcracker or a Rockette (not sure which) and <strong>Larry Severino</strong> 
        who, at the last minute, grabbed some scarlet fabric he had lying around 
        the house and deftly fashioned it into a copy of his <em>Forza</em> costume. 
        But the best costumes of all (and Ulrica is not ashamed in admitting a 
        fondness for things nautical) were the busboys in their smart, white yachting 
        uniforms.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Entertainment</strong> </font></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&#8230;was provided by a pair 
        of charming young singers, <strong>Matthew Trevino</strong> and <strong>Brian 
        Frutiger</strong>, who had a unique opportunity to perform in front of 
        two SFO General Directors (see below). Brian had <strong>Joan Imbeau</strong> 
        and <strong>Kimberly Thompson</strong> all a-flutter crooning &quot;Dein 
        Ist Mein Ganzes Herz&quot; to them, and Matthew was quick to point out 
        that he was a friend to Supers and, knowing that we are not strangers 

        to a <em>vendetta</em>, asked us to be kind to him if we ever happen to 
        share a stage.<br>
        <br>
        Other distinguished attendees included our Ohio Opera-tive <strong>Bruce 
        McNaughton</strong>, who jetted in for the event and took in seven SFO 
        performances in as many days; <strong>Don Stoddard</strong> who, happily, 
        is back on the dance floor after his <a href="../../people/stoddard.html">recent 
        motorcycle accident</a>; <em>Spearhead News</em>-er <strong>Lynn Meinhardt</strong> 
        sporting a streamlined new hairdo; Super <strong>Sharon Castle</strong> 
        who was deservedly applauded for making the Golden Gate Yacht Club available 
        to us; and <em>Star Wars</em> costuming <a href="../SW.htm">editorial 
        authority</a> <strong>Mark Burstein</strong> and his lovely wife <strong>Llisa</strong> 
        who proudly announced that they are expecting child number 2, a girl, 
        in April.<br>
        <br>
        Hammy Awards were given out to, among others: <strong>Al Heiben</strong> 
        for showing up before every <em>Dr. Atomic</em> performance as the Lt. 
        Bush cover (&#8220;They also serve who sit and wait,&#8221; quipped Al); 
        to another motorbike casualty, <strong>Walt Thorpe</strong>, for <em>The 
        Pearl Fishers</em>; in absentia to <strong>John Gugliemelli</strong> for 
        an onstage <em>Forza</em> collision with a principal: and to <em>L&#8217;Italiana</em> 
        Supers <strong>Ron Mann</strong> and <strong>Eddy Gordillo</strong> for 
        being Vlad the Impaler and for not being Vlad the Impaler respectively.<br>

        <font size="2">Pamela Rosenberg and General Director Designate <strong>David 
        Gockley</strong> both appeared at the party to rounds of applause, and 
        Pamela turned out to be the evening&#8217;s star performer; admitting 
        that, having had the Super Experience, she now knew what drives us to 
        do what we do and that she hopes, one day, to appear onstage as a giant 
        Redwood. Midway through her acceptance speech (she was also given a Super 
        spear pin made by Super jeweler <strong>Keith Bartel</strong>), she acknowledged 
        that she knew &#8220;we all had lives&#8221; at which one laconic partygoer 
        (reputedly <strong>Michael Strickland</strong>) responded &#8220;well, 
        not really&#8221;. </font></font></p>

        Supers for &#8220;hanging in there.&#8221; Getting his name engraved on 
        the Super of the Year plaque for 2005 will be <strong>Tom Carlisle</strong> 
        for his persistent efforts to photograph every Super and every principal, 
        for his meticulous work on the archival scrapbooks, for his <em>Spearhead</em> 
        interviews and for being a Super on top of all that. </font></p>

      <p><font size="2">One final, lasting 
        image of the evening was the tireless Super Committee gathering up crumpled 
        and soiled red napkins from the hastily abandoned dining tables. Oh the 
        glamour of a life on the stage&#8230;<br>
        <br>
        Leaving the party we were delighted by the brazenness of the raccoons 
        hanging around hoping for party leftovers (they were sure to be disappointed: 
        Supers are a plague of locusts when it comes to food).<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Opera for Kids</strong> </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Eager to see 
        Pamela&#8217;s Hammy Award-winning turn, Ulrica took in the last performance 
        of <em>The Magic Flute for Kids</em>. Overcoming her initial shock at 
        seeing Supers in the house wearing costumes and make up, she was soon 
        cheering the fuzzy animals and hissing the villains in their recycled 
        <em>Arshak II</em> costumes (one assumes that means no revivals of that 
        rarity in our immediate future) with one of the more enthuisiastic audiences 
        SFO has seen all season. The show was wonderfully conceived, beginning 
        with Maestro Runnicles leading the orchestra out while carrying a big 
        bass drum.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2">Following the

        we can look forward to <em>Elektra for Kids</em>. <strong>Tom Reed</strong>

        for <em>Medea for Kids</em>.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2">And while there 
        has been no official word about the 2006-07 season, I have it on good 
        authority that we will be seeing revivals of <em>Il Barbiere</em>, <em>Tristan 
        und Isolde</em> and <em>Carmen</em>. So dust off your mantillas, ladies, 
        crack open a pack of Marlboros and prepare for yet another trip to Sevilla.<br>
        <br>
        Speaking of opera and kids, Junior Super <strong>Seth Durrant</strong> 
        (Peter Oppenheimer in <em>Dr. Atomic</em>) created an incredible drawing 
        of himself onstage in <em>Dr A</em>. Note the crib, the concentric circles 
        on the floor, the hills in the background, Peter&#8217;s plaid PJs and, 
        of course, the suspended A-bomb. SFO is planning to use Seth&#8217;s drawing 
        to promote the opera in its future incarnations.</font></p>

        For those of us still missing <em>Dr A</em>, <strong>Keith King</strong> 
        suggests that fans rent the DVD of <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em> 
        for a surprise reprise of the Vishnu Chorus.</font></p>

      <p align="left">Well, what are the chances 
        that one could see two operas, playing simultaneously, that both feature 
        women named Leonora running around Spain in male drag? That would be <em>Fidelio</em> 
        and <em>La Forza del Destino</em>. Throw the W2W <em>Norma</em> into the 
        mix and we had a decidedly Sapphic ending to the season. No stranger to 
        Gender Confusion and the L-Word herself, Ulrica applauds another bold 
        move by the SFO&#8217;s Outreach Department.<br>

      <p align="left"><font size="2"><em>The 
        New York Times</em> reports that London&#8217;s Royal Opera has decided 
        to abandon its policy of &#8216;blacking up,&#8217; i.e., singers wearing 
        black skin makeup, saying</font> <font size="2">it wanted to be &#8220;sensitive 
        to issues of racism.&#8221; <img src="/funstuff/UlricaNov2005/beard.jpg" width="133" height="200" align="left">The 
        company made a last-minute change in its plans for Verdi&#8217;s opera 
        <em>Un Ballo in Maschera</em>, with the mezzo-soprano <strong>Stephanie 
        Blythe</strong> in the role of &#8211; yes &#8211; Ulrica, a fortune teller. 
        Ms. Blythe was &quot;blacked up&quot; during rehearsals but after an <a href="http://comment.independent.co.uk/columnists_a_l/philip_hensher/article327281.ece%20" target="_blank">article</a> 
        by columnist Phillip Hensher in <em>The Independent</em>, the company 
        made the laudible decision to overrule the director, Italian filmmaker 
        <strong>Mario Martone</strong>, at the last minute and had Ms. Blythe 
        sing the role in her natural, Caucasian skin color. Stripped of her black 
        makeup (above)<strong> </strong>Stephanie Blythe goes hirsute.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>The Fall of the House and Ushers</strong></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">But this 
        would not be an Ulrica column if there wasn&#8217;t something to moan 
        about and this month the spotlight is on the SFO ushers...</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">For 
        every friendly, smiling and professional <strong>Traude Albert</strong> 
        or <strong>John G Martin</strong>, there is an usher or usherette, who, 
        in the these security-minded times, feels that his or her role is to bully 
        those less fortunate than themselves, the impoverished standees, and insist 
        that they not &#8211; well - stand. One had an unfortunate run-in with 
        one such usherette, over an hour before curtain, for the last <em>Dr. 
        Atomic</em>. While chatting in the auditorium with standee friends, long 
        before the pre-performance lecture, an usherette rushes over to tell me 
        I could not stand where I was standing (safely behind the rail). Given 
        that there was an enormous pile of programs stacked where she thought 
        I should be, it was somewhat difficult to follow her directive. Unable 
        to move and under threats of being reported to the head usher, I left 
        my friends and retired to the safety of my dressing room.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">While 
        Ulrica is aware that ushers, too, are volunteering their time, surely 
        they could try to remember that even standees are paying customers and 
        should be treated with due respect. Increasingly I find myself distracted 
        during operas by the rear-of-house conversations (sometimes not so <em>sotto 
        voce</em>) of clusters of black-clad ushers, eager to dash into the empty 
        seats they so fearlessly guard from occupation by anyone else. <br>
        <br>
        Yet, the one time this standee could have used some usher support (when 
        a party of Russian visitors refused to leave previously occupied standing-room 
        territories) the usher forces were seen to actually flee the auditorium, 
        leaving said standee helplessly crying for the House Manager to intervene 
        and avert an international incident.<br>
        <br>
        And, really, how many times have you been forced by ushers to let them 
        give you directions to your seat, only to have them point you, counter-intuitively, 
        in the completely wrong direction, or made to enter your row from the 
        wrong side forcing the entire row stand to for you as you embarrassedly 
        take your seat on the far aisle?</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">As 
        it seems that the major requirement for ushering is not a desire to be 
        of service but a desire to see shows for free, Ulrica anarchically suggests 
        that next season, if funds are low, you wear a black suit, pin the attached 
        cut-out usher <a href="/funstuff/UlricaNov2005/ribbon.jpg" target="_blank">badge</a> 
        to your breast pocket and noisily bustle into an Orchestra Rear seat during 
        the quietest passage of the evening&#8217;s overture. If all the seats 
        happen to be occupied, don&#8217;t worry, you can always sit in the aisle.
