      <p align="center"><strong><font size="2">Sleepwalking in Chinatown</font></strong> </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0;"><font size="2">It&#8217;s not 
        a huge step &#8220;Out of the Box&#8221; from being a Super to being a 
        chorister (erstwhile Prince of Persia <img src="/funstuff/images/Ulrica4_2005/DSC_8996.jpg" width="184" height="277" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="right"><strong>Keith 
        Perry</strong> did it a few years ago) but <strong>Larry Severino</strong> 
        has been living a double operatic life, both supering and singing chorus 
        and <em>compramari</em> in some of the smaller Bay Area opera companies 
        such as the SF Lyric Opera and, now, California Opera.<br>
      <br>
        During April, California Opera did three performances of the under-valued 
        <strong>Bellini</strong> masterpiece <em>La Sonnambula</em> in San Francisco, 
        as well as performances <img src="/funstuff/images/Ulrica4_2005/_DSC8984.jpg" width="268" height="176" hspace="2" vspace="4" align="left">in 
        Pacifica and Rossmoor. Although it is a very difficult opera to perform 
        because of the vocal demands on the sleepwalking soprano, they put on 
        a very credible production, with <strong>Jamie Bonetto</strong> as the 
        title character, Amina, doing an outstanding job throughout, with the 
        elaborate coloratura of her two final arias &quot;Ah, non credea mirarti&quot; 
        and &quot;Ah! Non giungi&quot; (although it was a mistake to interrupt 
        them with narration) in particular. The confused hero Elvino was beautifully 
        sung by tenor <strong>Jimmy Kansau</strong>, who had the heartbroken sob 
        in his voice that serves Bellini so well.<br> 
      <br>
        Basso <strong>Sergey Zadvorny</strong> sang the role of the enigmatic 
        Count Rodolfo with a genuine and remarkable vocal presence (even though 
        he did not quite match up to the dashing figure <img src="/funstuff/images/Ulrica4_2005/_DSC8980.jpg" width="305" height="201" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="right">in 
        an officer&#8217;s uniform in which he was introduced) that was luxury 
        casting for such a small role. His singing should inspire CA Opera to 
        produce one of the smaller scale Russian operas for him. It would undoubtedly 
        draw a good crowd from the <em>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</em> we always see 
        showing up for the Russian works at the War Memorial. A small orchestra 
        of violin, cello, flute and <strong>Galina Umanskaya</strong> on piano 
        played the florid score beautifully, under the direction of <strong>Jonathan 
        Erman</strong>.<br>
      <br>
        I do believe there has to be an audience for well sung, low-production-value 
        performances of recondite operas in the Bay Area (especially off-season 
        like this) but the challenge for CA Opera is to reach it. The production 
        was not well advertised and attendance should have been higher. Although 
        they made a valiant effort to stage the piece it proved distracting under 
        the harsh lighting of Old St. Mary&#8217;s. <br>
      <br>
        Perhaps, <img src="/funstuff/images/Ulrica4_2005/DSC_8977.jpg" width="258" height="169" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="left">in 
        future, they might be better served by dropping the costuming in favor 
        of evening dress, singing from music stands rather than staging it and 
        putting their efforts into theatrical lighting. &quot;Ah, non credea&quot; 
        is one of <em>bel canto&#8217;s</em> most beautiful and transporting arias 
        and a simple spotlight would have worked wonders. But the group has good 
        singers to work with and if they can survive by singing rarely performed 
        operas they could fill a big need in the area. Pocket Opera, unfortunately, 
        has become a little tired after a few years.<br>
      <br>
        As for &#8220;our Larry&#8221; he shone in the chorus (which plays such 
        an important role in <em>Sonnambula</em>). He was in character throughout 
        and brought some tried-and-true Super gestures to the proceedings. <img src="/funstuff/images/Ulrica4_2005/_DSC8970.jpg" width="184" height="277" align="right">There 
        to cheer him on at this performance (there were generous discounts on 
        admission for SFO Supers) were the lovely <strong>Irene Bechtel</strong>, 
        webmaster <strong>Mike Harvey</strong>, <strong>Charlie Lichtman</strong>, 
        <strong>Chuck Yenson</strong> and myself. The evening gave us natives 
        a rare excuse to wander through Chinatown, marvel at the souvenirs on 
        display, and have a splendid dinner at the cheap and cheerful House of 
        Nanking.<br>

            <br>
              Mille grazie for coming to the performance Saturday. It's always
                    comforting to have friends in the audience. I think the supers
                    represented a good chunk of the audience that evening and
                      Sunday, disappointedly, did not draw that much more audience.<br>
                      <br>
              Andrew, you are absolutely right the bane of small local
                    opera companies is drawing enough audience and/or generous
                    donors to
                support themselves. So for now we are just doing &quot;fee per
                show&quot; performances. Old St. Mary's would take care of promotion,
                tickets, liability insurance, providing a venue, etc. We would
                pay the ensemble, accompanist, principal singers (only a stipend),
                rehearsal accompanist, etc. At best the fee covers maybe a quarter
                of these expenses.<br>
                <br>
              This is Old St. Mary's first try in utilizing the auditorium
                as a revenue producer (the church administrator is an opera lover).
                Certainly a little publicity amongst the parishioners doesn't
                do
                it. Another production is planned so, hopefully, things will improve.
                Pacifica (Sanchez Theater) and Rossmore always draw with their
                successful subscription series and retiree social program.<br>
                <br>
              I&#8217;ll send (the review) on to the troops. FYI, tenor Jimmy
            Kansau is in the extra chorus this year. He is quite talented.</font></p>
