        could say that I had my chances for the big win, a real Hammy, in the 
        <a href="../images/Traviatapics/Traviataintro.html">fall 2004 <em>Traviata</em></a>, 
        but sometimes circumstances conspire to rob you of that fifteen nanoseconds 
        of fame and misfortune. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">The 
        first factor working against me was “supernumerary instinct.” All had 
        gone well in rehearsals moving from stage right to stage left as Violetta's 
        party came to its grand conclusion. But in the heat of the final dress, 
        with hoops all about me, I made a spirited dash to get into position across 
        the stage. It was only instinct gained from years of supering that was 
        my undoing, a sense of irresistible forces colliding. I hit my brakes, 
        an ABS super-ultra-smooth stop.<strong>* Steve Clarke</strong>, right 
        behind me, with a nimble avoidance maneuver, observed Flora's expression 
        of horror at the impending collision. If only … I could've been somebody. 
        </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">The 
        next factor was the damnable conjunction of a klutz (me) and an absolutely 
        wonderful human being, <strong><a href="../Interviews/rohrerinterview.html">Katherine 
        “Kat” Rohrer</a></strong> [below, among Supers]. If only she had been 
        a little older, a little more experienced, she would have had me thrown 
        out of the show, and the Hammy would have been mine. But no, sh<img src="../images/Traviatapics/trav2/image/trav14.jpg" width="245" height="360" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">e 
        had to send the Supers bags full of sweets on opening night. When, at 
        the final dress, in my angst to exit quickly, being the last person to 
        leave the stage before Violetta's “Sempre Libera,” I stepped on Kat's 
        train, jerking her back into view just as she hit the doorway, did she 
        scream at me? No, Kat didn't say a word, not even a Super note at the 
        next performance. And when I repeated the stunt on opening night, the 
        same thing, not a word. The Merola Program needs a serious course in diva 
        behavior training. If only … </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">But 
        nothing matches the last one, having a prop sleuth on your tail. It all 
        started with Kat and her “Come on boys, let's give 'em some cook-kies” 
        as we dutifully tried to serve our canap&eacute;s — in reality, trans-fat 
        laden chocolate-dolloped dough — to the dining choristers. Those unwieldy 
        prongs just didn't work well in getting cookies off the serving plate. 
        But there was an elegant solution: lay the cookies one against the other, 
        in shiplap-siding fashion, and <em>voila</em>, problem solved. That is, 
        until the prop sleuth, after a lengthy two-minute investigation, got her 
        man. “Do you realize that you broke all of the cookies on the tray below 
        yours?” she snapped at me. My life flashed before my eyes. Would I be 
        charged with felony inappropriate handling of my prop or would it be a 
        mere misdemeanor touching charge? Reeling from the encounter and only 
        much later, in a true <em>esprit de l'escalier </em> moment did I realize 
        that the best solution would have been to <img src="images/XJ6HF.jpg" width="60" height="60" hspace="0" vspace="0" align="left">flick 
        the cookies, in sixth-grade fashion, off the tray, across the table and 
        into the laps of the choristers, and that Hammy would have been all mine. 
        Instead, I could only mope in obscurity, hoping for that lifetime-achievement 
        Hammy. If only … </font></p>
