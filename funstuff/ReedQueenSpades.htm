      <font size="2">Tom Reed, Chorus </font> 
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em>Act 
        I - Scene 1 - The Park</em> </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">It's 
        mid-June, and the long-awaited first day of spring has finally arrived 
        in lovely St. Petersburg, the “Venice of the North.” The overjoyed citizenry 
        rush the park, well aware that the return of bleak winter is just a couple 
        weeks away. The chorus is a study in contrasts, as giddy sopranos delight 
        in being in a Russian opera wearing only heavy jackets for a change, while 
        depressed altos moan that it's time to die. The merriment is short lived, 
        however. A pack of wild children briefly invades the square, sending the 
        terrified adults fleeing for safety. But after the All Clear, they return 
        to sing the happy springtime refrain, “<em>Nakanyetsta, bog paslal nam 
        solnyechniy dyenyook!</em>” (“So, that's what the sun looks like!”) </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">At 
        this point Tchaikovsky attempts to insert a plot. A guy named Gherman 
        is behaving kind of funny, so his friend Tomsky asks him what's wrong. 
        Turns out that Gherman is in love with someone, but he doesn't know who. 
        Sourin and Checkitinsky arrive and congratulate Prince Yeletsky on his 
        engagement to Lisa, who's there with “the Countess,” a Marylyn Monroe 
        rip-off who goes by the unlikely name of Venus d'Moscow. But wait a minute! 
        That's the same one he's in love with. (Lisa, not the Countess.) And she's 
        a card shark. (The Countess, not Lisa.) And they're both in love with 
        the same woman. (Yeletsky and Gherman, not the Countess and Lisa.) And 
        she's got the secret to the winning card combo. It's just starting to 
        make sense when the first thunderstorm of the season hits, barely fifteen 
        minutes after the arrival of spring! Panicked choristers dodge lightning 
        bolts and dash about stage singing, “<em>Graza! Kto b mog azhidat, strasti 
        kakiye! Oodar za oodaram gromchye strashnyeye!</em>” which is pretty much 
        all anyone can say under such circumstances.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em>Scene 
        2 - Lisa's Bedroom </em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Meanwhile, 
        back in Lisa's bedroom she and Paulina sing the light-hearted ditty “<em>Nooka, 
        svytik mashyenka ti patyesh paplyashi</em>,” to which the chorus women 
        are relieved to reply with only a series of relatively pronounceable “<em>Ay, 
        lyuli, lyuli</em>”s. Paulina offers to ask Yeletsky to release her from 
        her engagement (Lisa's to Yeletsky's, not Paulina's to Lisa's) because 
        it seems to have depressed her even more than the weather, but she decides 
        instead to sing a song begging for another lover. Gherman, having read 
        the libretto, appears right on cue.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em>Act 
        II - Scene 1 - A Ballroom </em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Yeletsky 
        is miserable about Lisa, Gherman is obsessed with the secret of the three 
        cards, and the chorus knocks itself out twisting and hopping around at 
        what was supposed to be a ball. But all the attention goes to a bunch 
        of puppets that completely steal the show. Even when twisting their heads 
        completely around while singing “<em>Bleestayet solntse krasna! Pastooshka 
        ti pryekrasna!</em>” the chorus fails to draw the audience's attention 
        away from the dummy with the cigarette. Then, just when the chorus starts 
        to get some notice again, who decides to crash the party? Oh, nobody. 
        Just Catherine the Great, Tsaritsa of all the Russias, that all. Ultimately 
        the chorus has no choice but to push all the way down to the lip of the 
        stage and blast out its welcome to the German-born Catherine. “<em>Slafsya 
        seem, Yekatyerina ... slafsya nyezhnaya k nam mat!</em>” (“You seem Slavic, 
        Catherine … you seem Slavic, but you're not!”)</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em>Scene 
        2 - The Countess's Bedroom</em> </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Gherman 
        is just dying to find out the secret of the three cards, so he sneaks 
        into the Countess's bedroom and hides. Never particularly good at timing, 
        he comes popping out demanding the winning combination just as she's having 
        a nice, relaxing bath. Turns out the poor old dear doesn't handle surprises 
        very well. Now with the Countess floating dead in the tub you'd think 
        Gherman might consider being perhaps a little more tactful in the future? 
        Noooo. All he can think about is the three cards … the three cards … Meanwhile 
        Lisa's beginning to suspect that Gherman just might have a wee gambling 
        problem. </font></p>

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em>Act 
        III - Scene 1- The Barracks </em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Lisa 
        writes Gherman asking him if he really loves her more than the cards, 
        but he's too busy sleeping with the Countess's skeleton to pay any attention. 
        Aside from being a great way to get a little extra calcium on the side, 
        it proves to be the only way to pry the secret out of her. Her ghostly 
        voice is heard telling him the winning card combination. But unbeknownst 
        to Gherman, she screws up and gets the last card wrong!! So much for pillow 
        talk with the dearly departed. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em>Scene 
        2 - An Embankment </em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Lisa's 
        getting really annoyed. First Gherman kills the Countess, and now he's 
        giving her the brush-off. (Lisa, not the Countess.) Lisa wonders why she 
        ever got involved with a tenor when she could have dated a baritone prince. 
        She'd jump in the river, but doesn't want to have to deal with the costume 
        department, so she suffocates herself with a Ziploc bag. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em>Scene 
        3 - The Casino </em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">It's 
        the big card game. The chorus men are drunk as usual, and things get pretty 
        kinky. Gherman, convinced that the ghost of the Countess gave him the 
        correct sequence of the winning cards, bets 40,000 rubles ($1.17) on the 
        first card, and wins! He ups the ante and wins again on the second card. 
        So of course now that he has a chance, the house refuses to play any more. 
        But ever helpful Yeletsky steps forward to challenge him — no small task 
        when standing on a heavily tilted gambling table. As Checkitoutsky flips 
        the final card, Gherman confidently proclaims that it is the ace. EEHHHH! 
        WRONG! It's the queen of spades. Couldn't he have figured that out from 
        the name of the show? I swear, most tenors just don't have both elevators 
        in the water.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Well, 
        now Gherman's really pissed for having trusted the bonehead Countess, 
        but who's he going to kill this time? A chorister? Who would care? So, 
        just to get it out of his system, he shoots himself. The chorus men, noticing 
        that he's not quite dead yet, make a mad dash for the dressing rooms in 
        hopes of beating the audience to the parking lots. But they stop offstage 
        just long enough to sing a fabulous final chorus based on the old Slavonic 
        hymn, “Pardon me boy, is that <em>izmoochyennooyoo dooshoo</em>?” </font></p>
