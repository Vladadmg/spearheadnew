      <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0;"><font size="2"><br>
        After many months of much-needed &quot;rest&quot; (i.e., no offer of a 
        role in the summer season), <strong>Y</strong>our <strong>O</strong>wn 
        <strong>U</strong>lrica has reluctantly agreed to return to the media 
        glare to ponder the question &#8220;Can a person be in two places at the 
        same time?&#8221;.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"> 
        What prompts this metaphysical musing was yesterday&#8217;s rehearsal, 
        at Zellerbach A, for the upcoming season starter, Giuseppe Verdi&#8217;s 
        masterful <em>Un Ballo in Maschera</em>. For anyone who is inexcusably 
        unfamiliar with <em>Un Ballo</em>, it should be pointed out that a crucial 
        character in the opera is a mysterious soothsayer who gives some &quot;Dear 
        Abby&quot; advice (&#8220;Go to that hideous field and pick the herb* 
        which grows at the foot of the stones of infamy.&#8221;) to our heroine 
        and foretells doom for our hero (&#8220;The next guy who shakes your hand 
        will be the cunning bastard who kills you.&#8221;).</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="1">* 
        She would be referring, of course, to the mandrake root (below), which, 
        as legend had it, grew from the ejaculated semen of men executed on the 
        gallows, and screams when it is pulled from the earth; Verdi was much 
        too polite to go into such detail.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2"><img src="../images/Ulrica24/GerardeMandrake.jpg" width="300" height="475"><br>
        Now, in this SFO production, the opera is restored to its original setting 
        in pre-Ikea, Age-of-Enlightenment Sweden. Verdi&#8217;s censors, fearful 
        of its theme of regicide (an attempt on the life of Napoleon III of France 
        had just been made), insisted he move it, oddly, to Colonial Massachusetts, 
        where it remained until a couple of decades ago. During the move West, 
        the homely Swedish wise woman, Madame Arvidson, became the more sinister 
        Native American sorceress Ulrica. Although the recent return to Scandinavia 
        meant that our hero Riccardo, Count of Warwick, was restored to his rightful 
        Gustavus III, King of Sweden, poor Mrs. Arvidson confusingly remains spooky 
        Ulrica. And therein lies our question&#8230;<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Who is this imposter?</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>Y</strong>our <strong>O</strong>wn <strong>U</strong>lrica, thanks 
        to the grace of Wardrobe, has been granted a role in <em>Ballo</em>: immobile 
        and partly hidden, it is a role nevertheless (remembering that being a 
        Super is an exercise in humility). As such, she makes a brief entrance 
        at the end of Arvidson/Ulrica&#8217;s one and only scene. Because of tight 
        scheduling, <strong>Y</strong>our <strong>O</strong>wn <strong>U</strong>lrica 
        has yet to step onstage with the Arvidson woman (played by contralto <strong>Tichina 
        Vaughan</strong>, below) but, if and when that happens, can we expect 
        a warp in spacetime, or merely a replay of <strong>Hayley Mills</strong> 
        in <em>The Parent Trap</em>?<img src="../images/Ulrica24/Vaughn.jpg" width="300" height="400" vspace="3"><br>
        Whilst <strong>Y</strong>our <strong>O</strong>wn <strong>U</strong>lrica 
        admits that the talented and likeable Ms. Vaughan has the edge in feminine 
        attributes and vocal abilities, Y.O.U. feels that her advanced &quot;experience&quot; 
        and reckless abandon could bring so much more to the role.<br>
        <br>
        Although loyal members of the Super <em>Spirito di Corpo</em> are suggesting 
        ways to do away with this singing wannabe, <strong>Y</strong>our <strong>O</strong>wn 
        <strong>U</strong>lrica has forbidden such action. This is, after all, 
        High Art and not <em>Showgirls</em>.<br>
        <br>
        (For the record, the name Ulrica was derived not only from the Ballo character 
        but also from the <em>nom de plume</em> of the gossip columnist in <strong>E. 
        F. Benson</strong>&#8217;s novel <em>Lucia in London</em>, the second 
        in the series of six hilarious novels <em>Mapp and Lucia</em>. Written 
        in the 1920s, they are required reading for all anglophiles and aficionados 
        of camp.)</font></p>

        publicity brochure is very handsome, but the copy obviously none too closely 
        scrutinized. Can you spot the two big mistakes in this: &#8220;<em>A Masked

      <p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">Who 
        was the chorister who warned a <em>Ballo</em> Super to &#8220;be very, 
        very careful&#8221; with his halberd? Apparently, the unfortunate chorister 
        was accidentally bonked on the head &#8220;by one of (y)our number&#8221; 
        in last year&#8217;s <em>Norma</em>. Although one would never suggest 
        that there may have been some provocation, one does wonder how one unfortunate 
        prior mishap might suggest that all Supers are, by nature, clumsy with 
        their props. Surely no one could ever think that all choristers are similarly 
        disagreeable.</font></p>

          the United States (the first two being <strong>Oliver Pollard </strong>of 
          MI and <strong>Bruce McNaughton</strong> of OH). Stock up on your Lipitor

        Ballo heroine <strong>Deborah Voigt </strong> coming to that Bash. After 
        famously undergoing gastric bypass surgery, a single Bucco entr&eacute;e 
        could prove fatal. The Little Black Dress brouhaha aside, Ulrica has always 
        regarded Deborah (whether Junoesque or svelte) as one of our most beautiful 
        and graceful performers and it is always an honor to have her on the War 
        Memorial stage.</font><font size="2"><img src="../images/Ulrica24/TristanVoigt2-400.jpg" width="288" height="396" vspace="3"></font></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;">After starting here as <em>Don 
        Carlos</em>&#8217; <em>Voce in Cielo</em> and <em>Macbeth</em>&#8217;s 
        Lady-in-waiting during the 1986 Season, Deborah&#8217;s first starring 
        SFO role was as the <em>Ballo</em> Amelia when she substituted, spectacularly, 
        for an ailing <strong>Susan Dunne</strong> in the 1990 revival. She is 
        fondly remembered, too, for an early appearance with the San Francisco 
        Gay Men&#8217;s Chorus, way back when.<br>
        <br> 
        It was Bradly who saw a jumbo-sized 
        rehearsal skirt being offered to Deborah a few days ago. Beautifully dressed 
        and streamlined, her look of utter disdain for the garment (which might 
        have fitted her many years ago) was, by his account, fit to kill.</p>

      <p><font size="2"> Answers to quiz, 
        above:</font></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"> 1. There is 
        nothing French about the opera. It is sung in Italian, premiered in Rome, 
        and is set in the U.S., Sweden or, very occasionally, Naples (see above).<br>
        <br>
        2. Everyone knows that the &#8220;incandescent duet&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;the 
        most expansive love duet Verdi wrote before <em>Otello</em>&#8221; (Kobbe&#8217;s 
        <em>Opera Book</em>) comes in Act II. The climax of the opera, surely, 
        is the Act III murder of the king at the eponymous Ball.</font></p>

    <td width="299" rowspan="2" valign="top" class="spearhead">      <p><font size="2"><strong>Let&#8217;s 
        Make Opera Accessible (Again)</strong><br>
          <br>
        We&#8217;ve tried it all: Broadway-style productions, the Bravo Club, 
        The Rainbow Series, Flute for Kids, simulcasts, titles translated into 
        English (<em>The Force of Destiny</em>) or otherwise altered (<em>Joan 
        of Arc</em>), yet still we need to entice the Opera audience back, and 
        to find new blood. The latest ploy is the elimination of intermissions 
        to make An Evening at the Opera a shorter experience and send everyone 
        home before BART shuts down and the Orchestra goes into overtime. <br>
                    <br>
        In order to preserve bar revenues and give us all an extra pee break, 
        Ulrica says keep the intermissions and get rid of some Acts. Would anyone 
        miss Act 3 of <em>Tristan und Isolde</em> (maybe skipping from the Prelude 
        to the <em>Liebestod</em>), the final act of <em>Le Nozze de Figaro</em>, 
        or the goofy antics in Act 2 of <em>Der Rosenkavalier</em>? Probably not. 
        And why bother with more than two acts of any <strong>Handel</strong> 
        Opera? We got the point after the first one. <br>
                    <br>
        <strong>Mike Harvey</strong> has a much more constructive suggestion, 
        <em>Tosca on Ice </em>or perhaps<em> Wozzek: the Dance Mix</em>, to which 
        Ulrica might add an audience-interactive <em>Traviata</em> (&quot;Violetta: 
        Live or Die? Vote Now!&quot;) or a sing-along <em>Lucia di Lammermoor</em>. 
        Evidently, Santa Fe Opera is leading the way with <em>The Tempest</em>, 
        staged as an Opera <a href="../../reviews/laurelsantafe.html">Aquacade</a>.

        <strong><em>Bravi Tutti</em> Merolini</strong><br>
          <br>
        Saturday, August 19th was the Grand Finale of the 2006 <a href="http://sfopera.com/merola.asp" target="_blank">Merola 
        Program</a>, and it is hard to imagine a more attractive and likeable 
        group of rising stars. Tenor <strong>Noah Stewart</strong> and Soprano 
        <strong>Heidi Melton</strong> brought the house down with their first-rate 
        Verdi arias (from <em>Luisa Miller</em> and <em>Ernani</em> respectively), 
        and there were stunning ensembles from <em>Candide</em> and <em>Tales 
        of Hoffmann</em> in a varied, though heavily French flavored, program.<br>
<br>
        Veteran Supers <strong>Susan Anderson</strong> and <strong>Andrew Korniej</strong> 
        had the opportunity to work with six of these young artists during the
         production of Cimarosa&#8217;s 18th-century comedy <em><a href="../../images/matrimoniopics/index.htm">Il
          Matrimonio Segreto</a></em> earlier this month. <img src="../images/Ulrica24/Segreto_Dress.jpg" width="295" height="197" vspace="3">With
          only six singers  and two Supers, it was perfectly proportioned and
          hilariously directed, 
        in a 1930s country-home setting, by former English National Opera movement
           director <strong>Nicola Bowie</strong>. The beautiful costuming was
           by SFO Wardrobe&#8217;s <strong>Kristi Lynn Johnson</strong>. Neither
           Busby  Berkeley nor (Gowns by) Adrian could have done any better.
           There were only two, sold-out performances so it was much too easy
           to miss.<img src="../images/Ulrica24/Segreto_Dress2.jpg" width="295" height="197" vspace="3"><font size="1"> photos
           by Kristen Loken</font><br>
           <br>
           All six twenty-something <em>Matrimonio</em> singers (<strong>Andriana
                     Chuchman</strong>, <strong>Caryn Marlowe</strong>, <strong>Jessica
                     Vanderhoof</strong>, 
        <strong>Kyle Albertson</strong>, <strong>Daniel Billings</strong> and 
        <strong>David Portillo</strong>) are prodigiously gifted in the vocal
         and acting spheres, and each is possessed of outstanding comic timing.
        
        The entire production company went out of its way to express appreciation
         for the Supers&#8217; contributions, a novelty in itself. As the two
         starchy  servants, Andrew and Susan were easily spotted: they were the
         ones with 
        wrinkles and gray hairs.<br>
                    <br>
        Much drama occurred during Final Dress rehearsal on Wednesday, August 
        2nd, when a 4.4 quake rattled the Fort Mason Pier. Although there was 
        much movement backstage, Ms. Chuchman and Mr. Billings sang through the 
        temblor like pros, never missing a beat. A feared tsunami failed to materialize, 
        but rumors of one gave the rest of the performance an added frisson.<br>
                    <br>
        Bravos are also due to now-regular Festival Opera (Walnut Creek) Supers 
        <strong>Charlie Lichtman</strong> and Mike Harvey (seen at far left, below) 
        for great work in their recent <em><a href="../../images/FOdongiovanni/FOdongiovanni.html">Don

        <strong>Y</strong>our <strong>O</strong>wn <strong>U</strong>lrica&#8217;s 
        fondness for the obscure silent movie performer has been well-documented 
        in previous columns. As an SFO Super, she closely identifies with their 
        under-celebrated-ness and, of course, with their lack of voice.<br>

                    <strong>On a more serious note...</strong><img src="../images/Ulrica24/breakin.jpg" width="295" height="98"><br>
        It behooves this columnist to issue a word of warning to any Super coming 
        to or from the Opera House these days. According to the SFPD, the incidence 
        of crime in the immediate vicinity of the House is way up in recent years, 
        with a lot of cars broken into while parked on the street. Four of the 
        eight current Super Committee members (<strong>Laurel Winzler</strong>, 
        <strong>Kimberly Thompson</strong>, Andrew Korniej and <strong>Walt Thorp</strong>) 
        have suffered break-ins while attending functions at the House. The danger 
        of personal or property damage can&#8217;t be overstated. Please be careful 
        around there. It is a dangerous neighborhood, and we are often walking 
        alone at odd times, before and after the Opera crowds. Paying for safe 
        parking is cheaper than replacing windows; don&#8217;t leave anything 
        valuable visible inside your vehicle; and try to car pool. Public transport 
        is a viable alternative, but Civic Center Station can be threatening, 
        too. Mike Harvey was harassed outside the station a couple of nights ago.<br>

        Late Breaking News: At an August 21st rehearsal, one fellow from the chorus 
        had his car broken into, in full daylight, on Franklin Street, just 20 
        yards from the ZA entrance. Apparently it was not the first break in of 
        the day. I spotted five other piles of shattered auto glass in the gutter 
        on one side of the block of Franklin from Fell to Hayes.<br>

If anyone has other incidents of crime in the area to report, please let <a href="mailto:flaurel1@aol.com">Laurel</a>,
or any member of the Super Committee know about them.</font></p>

                  <p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">And finally, 
        although it has been some months now, the SFO Super community is still 
        deeply affected by the loss, in a traffic accident, of one of its brightest 
        members, the lovely <strong><a href="../../committee/memorial.html">Katherine 
        Brazaitis</a></strong>. A memorial service was held for Katherine at her 
        church, The First United Methodist Church, in San Rafael on June 24th. 
        There was an impressive turnout of Supers wanting to celebrate her life. 
        On their behalf, <strong>Carolyn Waugh</strong> gave a beautiful eulogy 
        that struck the perfect note of grief at the loss and the joy and humor 
        of knowing and working with Katherine. There is optimism that the Company 
        might, in some way, acknowledge Katherine&#8217;s contribution to the 
        San Francisco Opera this season. Our sympathy remains with her husband, 
        Joseph.</font><font size="2"><br>
