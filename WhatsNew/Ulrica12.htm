        webmaster <strong>Mike Harvey</strong> took the month of February to relax 
        in San Miguel Allende in Mexico. His emailed postcards were a joy, but 
        Ulrica was alarmed to hear this account of Mike and his partner Paul's 
        close brush with death at breakfast one day:</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em>Yesterday 
        we visited Omanzin, an artist we met at the Instituto de Allende and bought 
        a few little treasures. Among the beautiful jade and bone sculptures and 
        amulets, he had a couple of very scary pre-Columbian gods that I was convinced 
        would be perfect arranged next to my Barcalounger in the rumpus room. 
        So we repaired to the Bellas Artes courtyard to consider things and to 
        have a lemonade, which is of course made with freshly squeezed limes. 
        We chose a table in the shade of a huge and ancient cedar tree. The moment 
        we sat down I heard some muted gasps from the loggia above us and suddenly 
        there was silence, and bark and debris started floating down on our table. 
        It was like the moment just before a tsunami hits when the tide has retreated 
        and all that potential energy is just about to transform into deadly kinetic 
        force. I assumed it was an earthquake and like good California boys we 
        bolted from our chairs and into the center of the courtyard just as a 
        500-lb limb broke off that cedar tree and crashed down onto our table. 
        </em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><em><img src="../images/limb.jpg" width="249" height="372"></em></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"><em>The 
        strange thing is that nobody seemed to take any particular notice. Within 
        seconds, the gardeners had removed the limb and swept up the remains of 
        the shattered planters, and life moved on. We went back to Omanzin's studio 
        and immediately swapped the pre-Columbian gods for a piece of amber filled 
        with petrified gnats. </em></font></p>

        in San Miguel, Mike came across the restored <strong>Angela Peralta</strong> 
        Theatre allowing Ulrica the opportunity to remember the glorious, but 
        sad, life and career of this nineteenth-century Mexican Diva. </font></p>

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Angela was
           a great favorite throughout her native Mexico during the 1880s. She
          was 
        renowned for her interpolated high e-flat at the end of the Triumphal
           Scene in <em>Aida</em>. Many years later this stunt was repeated by
           Maria  Meneghini Callas, then performing regularly at the Palacio
           de Bellas Artes 
        in Mexico City. The long and soaring note stunned the 1950 audience and
            outraged her tenor costar, Kurt Baum. We are lucky to be able to
           hear 
        her sing it on two live recordings from that period.  <a href="../Aidaclip.mp3">Click</a> to hear a
           brief sample of what it must have been like. O to have been a Super
           in that <em>Aida</em>! </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">But 
        back to poor Angela. She sailed to Mazatlan in August 1883 to sing in 
        <em>Rigoletto. </em> She arrived to such acclaim that the crowds waiting 
        to greet her unhitched the horses from her carriage and dragged it through 
        the streets to her hotel. She appeared at the upstairs balcony and performed 
        an impromptu concert for her ecstatic fans. However, the boat she had 
        arrived in was carrying Yellow Fever, which Angela contracted and, tragically, 
        died from a few days later. </font></p>

        Bartoli</strong></a>. Ulrica was the lucky recipient of a fifth-row-center 
        seat for her recent recital at Zellerbach Hall in Berkeley. Being so close 
        gave Ulrica a Super's-eye view of the Bartoli throat, but her prodigious 
        vocal gifts and personal charisma were everything that Ulrica had heard 
        over the last twelve years and she felt to be in the presence of true 
        divinity. (<em><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/02/17/DDGGH50U7G1.DTL" target="_blank">Chronicle</a></em><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/02/17/DDGGH50U7G1.DTL">

        was 
        spotted by Carrie a few days later but now seems to have disappeared.
         Could it have been stolen by some balletomane? If anyone has any clues

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">And 
        keep this to yourselves but here's a preliminary listing of Super roles 
        this fall. <em>Cosi </em> will have six men and three women, <em>Traviata 
        </em> eight men, <em>Billy Budd </em> thirty seafaring men, <em>Tosca 
        </em> thirty-five men, seven women and two children, <em>Fliegende Hollander 
        </em> five spinning women and one child, and <em>Eugene Onegin </em> will 
        have one man of a very specific yet-to-be-decided type. No Supers are 
        needed for <em>Le Grande Macabre, </em>sadly. Summer 2005 will give sixteen 
        men a chance to be swarthy and loin-cloth clad in the Zandra Rhodes production 
        of <em>Les Pecheurs du Perles </em> which <a href="http://www.sdopera.net//DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=2&tabid=140%20" target="_blank">debuted

        that these numbers are subject to change and further details will be announced 
        as they become available, so no phone calls to Carrie, please! If Ulrica 
        hears of any offenders she will be forced to cast an evil spell on them…
