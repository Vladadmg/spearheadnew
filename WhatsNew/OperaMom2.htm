                Fe was great -- particularly <em>Madame Mao</em>, a new opera 
                about Mao Tse Tung's wife, composer Bright Sheng, who lived through 
                it all in the Cultural Revolution in China. The libretto and direction 
                were by Colin Graham, who has directed a number of productions 
                here, most recently <em>Streetcar</em>, and did a great job with 
                this one as well. I was privileged to spend about three hours 
                with him over lunch. &nbsp;He is truly one of the greats. He started 
                as a young director, working with Benjamin Britten and directing 
                the premieres of all of Britten's operas (except for <em>Peter 
                Grimes</em>, as he was otherwise engaged). &nbsp;We have been 
                friends for about five years and had a wonderful afternoon together. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Young Anna Christy (soprano) was the young Madame Mao and she 
                is packing up to come here for <em>Mother of Us All</em>. &nbsp;You 
                will love her. &nbsp;I spent time with her, as well as conductor 
                Yves Abel, who was engaged here a number of years ago. &nbsp;Like 
                Marco Armillato, he is an up and coming Maestro in the firmament. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The frosting on the cake, however, was the beautiful and ebullient 
                Susan Graham. She came around and picked me up and whisked me 
                off to her new home in the hills. We sat out on the terrace, I 
                with her precious little dog on my lap, and watched the sun set 
                over the mountains, sipping strawberry margaritas. It was a magic 
                moment indeed when she started to sing -- that beautiful voice, 
                soaring out over the hills. I felt so privileged. <br>
                <br>
                Some singers are removed from the rest of us, either by conscious 
                or unconcious design. &nbsp;For some I suppose it is survival 
                or the fear of being "used" or the need for total privacy from 
                strangers. But Susan is a remarkable, lovable young woman with 
                a great talent, which she truly shares with people. &nbsp;Oh yes, 
                she sang in <em>La Belle H&eacute;l&egrave;ne</em> earlier in 
                the week and it was not only good singing but it was hilarious! 
                &nbsp; <br>
                <br>
                I am now off to Glimmerglass Wednesday morning.&nbsp;Four operas 
                with several singers well-known here (Christine Brandes and David 
                Pittsinger in "Orlando" for instance) and about four recent Merolini, 
                including Kevin Burdette. &nbsp;Home the following Monday, and 
                Tuesday night I leave for Australia and <em>Dead Man Walking</em> 
                with the gorgeous Teddy Tahu Rhodes! <br>
                <br>
                If I survive, I'll see you all at the opera! </font></p>
