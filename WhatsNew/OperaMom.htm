              the World with Pat Beresford </strong></font></h1>
            <h1 class="spearhead" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">I 
              am being the true &quot;Opera Mom&quot; this summer -- just returned 
              from a three-and-a-half week trip that included Vienna for 9 days 
              where I saw our great Deborah Voigt do her first Isolde and belive 
              me, Jane Eaglen better look out -- this is <strong>the </strong> 
              Isolde for the next decade -- she was absolutely glorious. &nbsp;Went 
              to five other operas at the fantastic Vienna State Opera, stayed 
              in a gorgeous hotel, which was also coping with the Rolling Stones 
              on their world tour! &nbsp;Believe me, they have not aged well! 
              &nbsp;At least they no longer tear up the hotel rooms and were quite 
              polite. &nbsp;Also saw Mel Ulrich several times -- he was &quot;my&quot; 
              Merola and Adler Fellow for four years when he was here several 
              years ago and is doing very well indeed. </font></h1>
            <h1 class="spearhead" style="margin-top: 0;"><font size="2"><br>
              Then it was off to Cardiff, Wales, and the Singer of the World Competition. 
              &nbsp;I have attended the last four competitions so they finally 
              decided to put me to work and I had a ball for ten days -- making 
              up press kits for the singers, taking them out to ease their nerves 
              and just being &quot;opera mom.&quot; &nbsp;For the first time they 
              had a lovely countertenor (from Munich) and some great baritones. 
              &nbsp;A Finnish baritone won and I am hoping we see him here as 
              I waxed ecstatic about him to Pamela Rosenberg. Remember the name 
              Tommi Hakala.</font></h1>
            <h1 align="left" class="spearhead" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"> 
              Saw my old pal, Bryn Terfel, who was in fine spirits -- he was one 
              of the winners of this competition in 1987, together with Dmitri 
              <font style="color:black;">Hvorostovsky </font>. &nbsp;On to London 
              and a visit with John Copley who was in great form and looks marvelous. 
              &nbsp;Went to <em>Magic Flute </em> starring Paul Groves and <em>Semele 
              </em> (the same one we did a couple of years ago) with Ruth Ann 
              Swenson and John Relyea. &nbsp;The latter has quite an enormous 
              career going for him -- another Adler/Merola success story. &nbsp;Spent 
              a couple of days with him and his wife, Marina, and their two little 
              boys. <br>
              <br>
              One of the highlights of the trip was a private tour backstage at 
              the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. &nbsp;When we started it, 
              we heard singing from the main house. &nbsp;Our fantastic guide 
              slipped us into the back of the stalls -- it was Domingo rehearsing 
              <em>Pagliacci </em> and he wasn't &quot;marking.&quot; &nbsp;The 
              man is still amazing and the voice just beautiful. &nbsp;The backstage 
              area is so state-of-the art it boggles the mind: stages (four of 
              them) that drop down at the touch of a switch and glide toward the 
              mainstage where they are raised to the proper level. &nbsp;In this 
              way they can have four complete sets, counting the one in use, ready 
              to go. &nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              I'm off to Santa Fe for 5 operas, then Glimmerglass ( Cooperstown, 
              New York ) and 15 hours after arriving home I will be on the way 
              to Australia and <em>Dead Man Walking </em>, in which Teddy Tahu 

              Rhodes will once again sing Joe DeRocher.&nbsp;I am sure by now 
              the ladies are gnashing their teeth -- Teddy made quite a splash 
              here -- but the really good thing is that he is doing some great 
              work now and really moving up the ladder. &nbsp;I understand there 
              was a poll of &quot;The 10 Sexiest Men in Opera&quot; and he figured 
              right up there at the top of the list. &nbsp;Hey, this old lady 
              knows a good thing when she sees/hears it! &nbsp;And he is a baritone!
