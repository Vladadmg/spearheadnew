        given a choice among hearing a lyric coloratura of luminous, pure, and 
        celestial vocalism; seeing a superb theatrical actress at the peak of 
        her powers nailing every nuance while tearing up the stage in a riveting 
        performance; or observing a young woman of radiant beauty cavort about 
        in a thin nightdress, one might have pause. Yet here the answer is, of 
        course, &quot;all of the above&quot; as Anna Netrebko gives yet another 
        jaw-dropping performance, this time as the mad Lucy of the Lammermoors. 
        But I am ahead of myself…</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We 
        arrived a bit early at the Chandler Pavilion, giving us enough time to 
        check out the new Frank Gehry-designed <a href="http://www.musiccenter.org/wdch/" target="_blank">Walt 
        Disney Concert Hall</a> next door, as well as play with the four Irish 
        Wolfhounds who would be performing supernumerary roles in the first scene 
        of <em>Lucia</em>.</font></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The 
        hall itself is that gaudy <em>moderne</em> early-sixties too-many-chandeliers 
        look; acoustics are adequate; the audience noisy. As the stage and backstage 
        areas are small, long scene changes were necessitated, along with some 
        horrid tapes of “Seagulls at the Seashore” honking at us during the breaks, 
        where talking was not discouraged and moods were broken.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The 
        scenery by and large was monochrome gray and lit by the same sight-impaired 
        technician who gave us our recent <em>Trovatore</em> and <em>Carlos</em>. 
        However, when there <em>was</em> a scene with good light, the contrast 
        was stunning. In Enrico's study, as he was dressed in a rich red robe, 
        silhouetted against the dramatic sky or sitting by a fireplace adorned 
        with 36 large deer heads (akin to the “<a href="http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/skulls/" target="_blank">Skulls</a>” 
        exhibit at the California Academy of Sciences), the visuals were splendid. 
        As was the moon-caught-in-the-branches-of-the-tree snowscape. Lots of 
        rolling stage fog.</font></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Costuming 
        was a bit odd: Edgardo was in a tux, Arturo in a Gilbert-and-Sullivan-Tenor 
        “do” and the chorus in various muted suits. Enrico and Lucia, by contrast, 
        were in fine jewel tones throughout. It seems the director, Marthe Keller, 
        a theatrical and film actress of some note, had never seen a chorus before. 
        They were given to perform the most godawful ham-fisted unison hand gestures 
        seen outside of a kindergarten pageant. This was surprising, as her direction 
        of the principals and their interactions was, by and large, excellent.</font></p>
                  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Edgardo 
        (Jos&eacute; Bros) was a tenor of fine tone and musicality, although short 
        enough to be dwarfed by most of the scenery, including an oversize chair 
        which gave him an “Edith Ann” sort of look. Normanno (Javier Cortes) was 
        thankfully inaudible given what we <em>could </em> hear, and had on a 
        Sideshow Bob fright-wig. (At least, I hope it was a wig.) The bass, Raimondo 
        (Vitaliz Kowaljow), was just another of those Russian splendors of stentorian 
        tone. The chorus did not have the richness of blended tone I've grown 
        used to at SFO; the orchestra (conducted by Jules Rudel) just fine.</font></p>

      <p style="margin-top:0;"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
        Enrico, baritone Franco Vassallo was a beacon of enchanting musicality 
        and dramatic fire from the moment he walked onstage. Even though he was 
        the &#8220;bad guy,&#8221; he certainly took the afternoon's (male) vocal 
        honors. (In the duets, it reminded me of why I like Miss Netrebko in the 
        Russian repertoire so much: her tone blends so beautifully with the baritones 
        and basses which make up the heroes of Russian opera.) SFO: please take 
        note. He's young, he's good looking, he's Italian, and he sings like a 
        god.<br>
        <br>
        Oh, yes, there was this soprano. My admiration for Miss N's many talents 
        is not exactly a state secret, and it began when she opened her mouth 
        to sing -- for the very first time outside her native Russia --about six 
        feet from my ear (<em>Ruslan and Lyudmilla</em>, '95 of course). In the 
        eight years since, she has done everything right and is now, at 32, poised 
        to become the darling of the opera world. Rarely have such accolades been 
        so well deserved.<br>
        <br>
        In hearing her pitch-perfect and silvery pure renditions of the lyric 
        and coloratura repertoire, one may forget what a formidable actress she 
        is. Physically, in a manner akin to Fred Astaire &quot;making the hat 
        stand look good,&quot; she can wrap her arms around the stiffest tenor 
        (that's in an acting sense, you pervs) and evoke Romance. Her unforgettable 
        rendering of the &quot;mad scene,&quot; so often done at full gallop, 
        was a coup de th&eacute;&acirc;tre with a rich palette of shades of emotion 
        and laser focus, and her earlier contribution to the Sextet had left one 
        drained.<br>
        <br>
        I will soon run out of adjectives for this exhilarating, miraculous talent.<br>
        <br>
        <em>Lucia</em> plays through December 20th. Go!<br>
        <br>
        And check out Anna's <a href="http://www.annanetrebko.com/" target="_blank">official</a> 
        or her <a href="http://windhorst.org/netrebko/" target="_blank">aficionado</a>'s 
        websites for more doings.<br>
        <br>
        Buy her new CD - at least you can taste Lucia, as the scena and cavatina 
        &quot;<em>Ancor non giunse! ... Regnava nel silenzio</em>&quot; (Act I, 
        scene II - the fountain) can be heard. By the way, the epigraph at the 
        top of this review is the very beginning of her &quot;mad scene&quot; 
        (with gender changed.) </font></p>
