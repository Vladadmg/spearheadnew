      <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> <br>
        SFO Super and Berkeley Celtic Studies Professor <strong>Dan Melia,</strong> 
        who appeared in many operas from 1989 to 1993 but has not been seen on 
        the Opera House stage in recent years, made a triumphant return to TV&#8217;s 
        <em>Jeopardy</em> on April 13th.<br>
        <br>
        Dan had been a winning contestant back in 1998 when he went home with 
        $175,000 and a Corvette. He was one of 45 previous <img src="/funstuff/images/Ulrica4_2005/jeopardy.jpg" width="250" height="906" align="right">winners 
        who qualified for the second round of the Ultimate Tournament of Champions 
        and easily beat out two contestants with very bad hair, Kyle and Rick, 
        winning a staggering $37,000 and the chance to go on and compete for $2 
        million! Yaaayy!!<br>
        <br>
        Dan was introduced by <strong>Alex Trebek</strong> as &#8220;one of the 
        most interesting Irish-Americans&#8221; and did extremely well in most 
        categories, especially &quot;Shocking Art&quot; (&#8220;Who was <a href="/funstuff/images/Ulrica4_2005/botticelli.jpg" target="_blank">Botticelli</a>?&#8221; 
        and &#8220;What was the <a href="/funstuff/images/Ulrica4_2005/duchamp.jpg" target="_blank">Armory 
        Show</a>?&#8221;); &quot;Presidents&quot; (&#8220;Who was <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/rh19.html" target="_blank">Rutherford 
        B. Hayes</a>?&#8221; -- a very good question); &quot;Quotes&quot; (topically 
        &#8220;Who is <a href="/funstuff/images/Ulrica4_2005/camilla.jpg" target="_blank">Camilla 
        Parker Bowles</a>?&#8221; [and &#8220;What has she got on her head?&#8221;]; 
        and &quot;Calories&quot; (&#8220;What is <a href="http://www.wendys.com/w-1-0.shtml" target="_blank">Wendy&#8217;s</a>?&#8221; 
        which earned him big bucks). &quot;Child Stars&quot; seemed to be his 
        only weakness, as he failed to respond with &#8220;Who is <a href="/funstuff/images/Ulrica4_2005/shirley.jpg" target="_blank">Shirley 
        Temple</a>?&#8221; and &#8220;Who is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001593/" target="_blank">Anna 
        Paquin</a>?&#8221; but he triumphed with &#8220;Parris NC&#8221; for $2,000 
        with &#8220;What is a Pugil Stick?&#8221; which he knew, no doubt, from 
        carrying so many spears and halberds onstage (in case you are wondering 
        &#8220;What is a <a href="/funstuff/images/Ulrica4_2005/marines.jpg" target="_blank">Pugil 
        Stick</a>?&#8221; yourselves it is, apparently, a big, squishy red cylinder 
        that U.S. Marines use to practice their fighting skills with).<br>
        <br>
        Alex Trebek got quite excited by it all, saying that Dan was &#8220;on
         fire&#8221; and &#8220;that good&#8221; as he sailed, effortlessly,
         to  victory with &#8220;Who is (Sir) <a href="/funstuff/images/Ulrica4_2005/francisdrakehotel.jpg" target="_blank">Francis
          Drake</a>?&#8221; for $3,600. Dan's
        appearance in the next round will be on May 16th. For more information

        <br>
        Meanwhile if you pull out your videotape of the 1993 SFO <em>Turandot</em> 
        and look very closely, you might spot Dan Melia in Act I upstage left, 
        in black, in the dark; which is, after all, a Super&#8217;s usual lot. 
        It would be nice to see him back on stage and hope that the Super Casting 
        Department was watching ABC Wednesday night.</p>

      <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0;">And another Super 
        we haven&#8217;t seen enough of recently (because he lives in New York) 
        is <strong>Doug Couture</strong> who found himself on our pages whilst 
        Googling himself and sent the following note:</p>
      <p><em>Hey you guys,<br>
        &nbsp; <br>
        I just Googled myself and was pleased and surprised to find the pic of 
        <strong><a href="http://spearheadnews.com/images/newflutepics/flutevault.html" target="_blank">Harrison 
        Pierce</a></strong> from </em>Magic Flute<em> in there. Just wanted to 
        thank you for the nice copy that was written as well.<br>
        <br>
        Hope that you all are well, I am still in NY working soaps and part time 
        on Broadway. I'm hoping to make it out there this fall. I hear that there 
        have been many an improvement since I left in '94.<br>
        &nbsp; <br>
        Sincerely,<br>
        &nbsp; <br>
        <a href="mailto:moduspike@hotmail.com">Douglas Couture</a></em></p>
      <p>Doug supered in the early Nineties (<em>The Magic 
        Flute</em> and <em>War and Peace</em>) and then worked as a Super dresser 
        for a few seasons. He says he still stays in touch with his wardrobe mentor 
        David Barnard. Always good to hear that ex-Supers are thriving outside 
        of SFO.</p>
