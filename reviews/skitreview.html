    <td width="321" rowspan="2" valign="top" class="spearhead"><p><font size="2"><strong>Just 
        as in <em>Das Rheingold</em></strong>, the Prologue to this year&#8217;s 
        Super skit introduced us to the themes and motifs that were carried through 
        the following three acts; in this case, however, the themes and motifs 
        hit a little closer to home and were infinitely funnier to the captive 
        audience. It began with two backstage personnel (<strong>Jenny Jirousek</strong> 
        and <strong>Andrew Korniej</strong>) bickering over the status of an umbrella, 
        asking that profound question, &#8220;Is it a prop or is it a costume?&#8221; 
        The familiar operatic in-fighting was disrupted by <strong>Katherine Brazaitis</strong>, 
        note-perfect with her headset-wearing, harried Stage Manager.<br>
        <br>
        From there we were taken to a kindergarten where bratty children--<strong>Susan 
        Anderson</strong> (adorable in pigtails), <strong>Marcel Delgado</strong> 
        and <strong>Grove Wiley</strong>--demanded to hear scary stories of the 
        opera. <img src="../events/party/party2/party2-Thumbnails/9.jpg" width="118" height="79" align="left">And 
        what could be scarier than the fate of SFO Super Captains? When asked 
        to define a Super the kids&#8217; responses got roars of approval: (Supers) 
        stand on stage a long time, (Supers) get replaced by stagehands and ballet 
        dancers, (Supers) take pictures of principals, etc. etc. All three managed 
        to let their Inner Child run rampant and almost caused a riot with their 
        screams of horror whenever a certain Southern California city was mentioned!<br>
        <br>
        Act One was brought to an abrupt halt by the first fire alarm of the evening; 
        we were then led on to the executive offices of SFO where <strong>Mike 
        Harvey</strong> and <strong>Mimi Timberlake </strong><img src="../events/party/party2/party2-Thumbnails/10.jpg" width="79" height="118" align="right"> 
        began auditions for a new Super Captain. <strong>Priscilla Lore</strong> 
        looked like Eve Arden and sounded like Judy Holliday as a timid secretary 
        bringing on a cast of backstage personnel interviewing for the-less-than-desirable 
        position.<br>
        <br>
        First up was the disinterested stage manager (<strong>Katherine</strong>) 
        who exited cuing the Lighting Director. There was a roar of recognition 
        as <strong><img src="../events/party/party2/party2-Thumbnails/11.jpg" width="118" height="79" align="left">Paul 
        Newman</strong> led on a blinded, olfactory-sensitive <strong>Michael 
        Strickland</strong> in a brilliant pastiche of the somber entrance of 
        <em>Don Carlos</em>&#8217; Grand Inquisitor. Next up was an inspired Prompter 
        in a Box (<strong>Bruce McNaughton</strong>) quietly cueing the executives 
        and himself.<img src="../events/party/party2/party2-Thumbnails/12.jpg" width="118" height="79" align="right"> 
        A ditsy, umbrella-hurling Props Manager (<strong>Jenny</strong>) preceded 
        an arch Wardrobe Person (<strong>Andrew</strong> playing Jenny Green) 
        who walked offstage taking a well-timed cell phone call from Placido Domingo. 
        </font> </p></td>
    <td width="316" rowspan="2" valign="top" class="spearhead"><p><font size="2">The 
        final, unsuspecting interviewee was <strong>Lisa Lorea</strong>, brilliantly 
        revealing herself in a Doris Day moment, with &#8220;My name is Carrie, 
        Carrie Murphy,&#8221; <img src="../events/party/party2/party2-Thumbnails/14.jpg" width="118" height="79" align="right">as 
        she slipped off her eyeglasses and virtually undid her bun and let her 
        hair fall down around her shoulders. Lisa did a charming and rather accurate 
        impersonation of Carrie, who seemed to be laughing louder than anyone 
        else in the audience.<br>
        <br>
        Another fire alarm cut Act Two &quot;short&quot; but we were soon attending 
        one of those Opera Company morale-boosting parties to introduce the new 
        Super Captain. <strong>Katherine Brazaitis</strong> <img src="../events/party/party2/party2-Thumbnails/16.jpg" width="79" height="118" align="left">did 
        an excellent Pamela R. with sloooow, deliberate diction, interspersed 
        with Teutonisms like &#8220;Oper-Schmutz&#8221;, which already seems to 
        have entered the Super lexicon. &quot;Pamela&quot; was followed onstage 
        by <strong>Darcy Fink</strong>, as a development department person, panhandling 
        spare change for the Opera. For those who attended any of last year&#8217;s 
        Opening Night parties, Katherine&#8217;s string of words beginning with 
        &#8220;super&#8221; (but never ending in &#8220;numerary&#8221;) would 
        strike a chord, as would her readiness to be distracted by the demands 
        of her dramaturg.<br>
        <br>
        The climactic scene of <em>Fedora</em> transported us into new Super Captain 
        Carrie&#8217;s worst nightmare; The Night of the Living Dead Supers. <img src="../events/party/party2/party2-Thumbnails/18.jpg" width="118" height="79" align="left">Carrie 
        cheerfully took up her new duties only to become faced with the frightening 
        reality of dealing with demanding Supers as eight zombies, <img src="../events/party/party2/party2-Thumbnails/20.jpg" width="118" height="79" align="right">all 
        carrying umbrellas, sleep-walked through the audience to a chorus of &#8220;Carrie&#8230; 
        Carrie&#8221; and surrounded her onstage. Screaming &#8220;STOP!&#8221; 
        <strong>Lisa</strong> burst through the zombies, and for the riotous finale 
        had four new Production Super Captains (<strong>Nancy</strong>, <strong>Charlie</strong>, 
        <strong>Larry</strong> and <strong>Bruce</strong>) lead the whining mass 
        back through the <img src="../events/party/party2/party2-Thumbnails/21.jpg" width="118" height="79" align="left">audience 
        like the Gods on their entry into Valhalla!<br>
        The skit was consistently hilarious with its up-to-the-minute seasonal 
        references such as the <em>Don Carlos</em> fire alarms, &#8220;changing&#8221; 
        production values and, of course, the ubiquitous Fedoras. The cast was 
        both well-rehearsed and improvisational and the range of characters cleverly 
        drawn. <br>
        <br>
        After group bows author, director and narrator <strong>Charlie Lichtman</strong> 
        was deservedly called back onstage by <strong>Stephanie Salter</strong> 
        to take a solo one and received the first standing ovation of the evening.
