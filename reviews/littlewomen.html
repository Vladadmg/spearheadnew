      <h4>Expat super critiques Dayton Opera premiere</h4>
      <p><img src="/funstuff/images/littlewomen.jpg" width="150" height="265" align="left">The Dayton Opera production of <em>Little
          Women</em> in April took me by
        surprise. I am in what I suppose is a very small minority of people who
        have never
      read the book, nor seen any of the film treatments of the Louisa May Alcott
      novel. As a result, my only knowledge of the characters and plot came from
      an old episode of Friends, and a brief lecture at the local library (where
      my main interest was the possibility of sucking up to whoever showed up
      from the Dayton Opera as the guest presenter).<br>
&nbsp;
      <br>
      So I knew a sister died (it is, after all, an opera), and that many of
      the relationships were strained. Thus, I did not expect the large number
      of humorous moments, nor did I expect to finally experience an opera that
      actually seemed relevant to my personal situation. As much as I enjoy listening
      to operas such as <em>Nabucco</em> and <em>Simon Boccenegra</em>, it is difficult for me
      to relate to a crazed king with a power-hungry illegitimate daughter, or
      to a more benign ruler with yet another illegitimate daughter.<br>
&nbsp;
      <br>
      <em>Little Women</em>, however, was driven by a more universal concept &#8211; the
      reality that &#8220;things change.&#8221;&nbsp; If the changes in our lives
      cannot be controlled as much as we would like, it is at least advisable
      to recognize the inevitability of change, to be open to the new possibilities,
      and to be willing to make suitable adjustments and adaptations.&nbsp; From
      a personal perspective, that makes me feel better about the changes I made
      in the past year.<br>
&nbsp;
      <br>
      Being somewhat musically challenged, I am not really qualified to review
      an actual production (I&#8217;m not sure if some of the professional critics
      are much better), but a critique is what I was asked to prepare.&nbsp; From
      an operatic perspective, <em>Little Women</em> was very well produced, as all of
      us would expect from our favorite director, <strong>Sandy Bernhard</strong>.&nbsp; As always,
      Sandy was able to bring out detailed character and scene elements, which
      also resulted in the many mood-lightening moments in an otherwise potentially
      depressing story.<br>
&nbsp;
      <br>
      I anticipated a less than melodic musical evening from this very modern
      opera, but was again surprised at the pleasing nature of most of the music.
      And (as has been my observation so far with the Dayton Opera), all the
      principals were young, energetic, and blessed with wonderful voices.&nbsp; The
      sisters included <strong>Jennifer Rivera</strong> (Jo), <strong>Julia Bentley</strong> (Meg), <strong>Mary
      Elizabeth Southworth</strong> (Beth) and <strong>Deborah Selig</strong> (Amy).&nbsp; Ms. Rivera was particularly
      impressive, especially given the amount of time she was required to sing.&nbsp; Jo
      was in almost every scene during the 2 1&#8260;2 hour performance.<br>
&nbsp;
      <br>
      The set was simply but effectively designed, with an entire wall of the
      house used as a back drop, and multiple levels in front that served as
      a garden, main rooms, and attic. Windows that dropped in during the second
      act created the separate geographical areas from which the scattered family
      members could correspond during the letter scene.&nbsp; The orchestra (the
      Dayton Philharmonic Orchestra) was led by its regular conductor,
      <strong>Neal Gittleman</strong>, so the music from the pit was tight and cohesive.<br>
&nbsp;
      <br>
      The only noticeable flaw was the absence of supers.&nbsp; As hard as I
      tried, however, I was not able to spot any scenes where a super could have
      added anything useful to the production, even when props were being moved
      about on stage.&nbsp; I also found myself wishing that ice cream was available
      during intermission (as it is in Cincinnati), but that seems to be on my
      mind in most situations now.<br>
&nbsp;
      <br>
      From a personal perspective, I am now fairly well settled in the condo,
      and I am ready to take advantage of the spring weather that finally arrived.&nbsp; I
      was looking forward to all the trees, shrubs and flowers in bloom, as well
      as getting out to explore the area on my bike (I think I have managed to
      get myself back to an acceptable level of exercise tolerance). I have also
      found a bike group through one of the senior centers that goes out on weekly
      rides, so that should be a safe way to get back into riding.<br>
&nbsp;
      <br>
      As expected, I miss a lot about the Bay area, and I am looking forward
      to at least a couple trips back later this year, probably in conjunction
      with the opera season. Stay well, and be sure to let me know if your travel
    plans take you unexpectedly into southern Ohio.</p>
