        Super <em>Don Giovanni</em> in Avignon<br>
        </font></strong><font color="#990000"><font color="#000000">by Mike Harvey
        </font></font> </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Mozart's 250th 
        birthday was this year and it seems that every opera company in the world 
        celebrated it with performances of his most popular works. <em>Don Giovanni</em> 
        checked off his list of conquests in major houses including Walnut Creek's 
        Festival Opera, the Paris Opera Garnier, an <a href="http://www.sfopera.com/opera.asp?o=246" target="_blank">upcoming 
        SF Opera production</a> next summer and recently, in a glittering outing 
        at L'Op&eacute;ra-th&eacute;&acirc;tre d'Avignon in that most agreeable 
        Provencal city. <br>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.mairie-avignon.fr/en/tourisme/operaen.php" target="_blank">L'Op&eacute;ra-th&eacute;&acirc;tre 
        d'Avignon</a> has a <a href="http://www.festival-avignon.com/index.php?lg=en" target="_blank">short 
        season</a> of only three performances of three productions as the house 
        is constantly used for concerts, plays, recitals, ballet, and anything 
        that requires a stage. Consequently, this <em>Don Giovanni</em> was the 
        hottest ticket in town, and the only seats available for the October 27 
        opening night performance were in the 4th balcony, top row center. The 
        ticket office was quick to make the strangely ominous assurance that one 
        could hear the music from that vantage point.<br>
        <br>
        This was an eagerly awaited and completely sold out production from l'Op&eacute;ra 
        de Marseille featuring Marina Poplavskaya as Donna Anna, Michelle Canniccioni 
        as Donna Elvira, Eric Martin-Bonnet as Leporello, and Nicolas Cavallier 
        as the Don. It was definitely a major event and at thirty minutes before 
        curtain the Avignon glitterati could be seen tossing back oysters, steak 
        frites, and champagne at the Opera Cafe across the Place de l&#8217;Horloge. 
        <br>
        <br>
        At ten minutes, a trumpeter paraded around the front steps of the theater 
        playing a hopeful fanfare in an attempt to coax the audience away from 
        their <em>tartes tatin</em> and espressos. Finally it seemed that the 
        entire audience had received their cue from some unseen ASM and they arrived 
        <em>en masse</em> and formed a grand procession to enter the theater at 
        fifteen minutes past curtain time. <br>
        <br>
        Curiously, the 4th balcony was not reachable from the beautiful lobby 
        of this charming italianate theater. One had to go into the basement and 
        exit into a shabby back-stairs area and climb five flights to emerge on 
        a platform slightly above ceiling level<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">—</font>looking 
        straight down into the orchestra pit. To save room, or perhaps to provide 
        an atmosphere of <em>la vie boh&eacute;me</em>, there were no actual seats 
        in the 4th balcony. There were five rows of hard shelves and the top row 
        was indeed at least 30 inches above the ornate baroque ceiling. It was 
        necessary to lean left or right and down in order to see the stage. This 
        provided an opportunity to get to know your neighbors rather intimately. 
        The lady on the left explained that she hated opera but her husband had 
        a front row orchestra seat. She was there to keep an eye on him with her 
        binoculars. And indeed at one point during the performance she was heard 
        to suddenly gasp and mutter &quot;<em>merde</em>&quot; as she bolted from 
        her perch and headed for the exit.<br>
        <br>
        The show started at least thirty minutes late but nobody seemed to mind 
        as there was a great deal of socializing to be done. People were calling 
        out to each other from various parts of the house and there were hundreds 
        of cell phone conversations to complete before the <em>maestro</em> finally 
        entered the rather enormous pit and began the overture. <br>
        <br>
        The curtain rose on a dark, empty stage which seemed to represent a courtyard. 
        At various times rather solid-looking walls would fly in and somehow move 
        laterally SL or SR only to fly out again. All of the principals were young 
        and attractive, with strong, pleasing voices. Nicolas Cavallier made a 
        handsome Don Giovanni and it was easy to see why all the ladies kept falling 
        into bed with him. The two Donnas were beautiful to look at and very capable 
        artists. The orchestra sounded lush and the ticket lady was correct in 
        that the acoustics in the rafters were superb.<br>
        <br>
        It was the Supers, however, who really stole the show. They were everywhere. 
        Bringing in chairs, taking out chairs, pretending to be asleep until required 
        to leap up and bring in or out yet more chairs. There were townspeople, 
        ladies, gentlemen, lackeys, oafs, oafesses, assorted non-lackey servants, 
        and lots of beautiful young men and women for the party scene, constantly 
        moving, chatting, <img src="../images/Avignon%20Don%20Giovanni/supers.jpg" width="250" height="333" hspace="3" vspace="3" align="right">teasing, 
        kissing, chasing, dancing, eating enormous ice cream cones during the 
        party, and having a fine time. <br>
        <br>
        At the conclusion of Act I, it was necessary to make the decision to either 
        leave the theater or pass out from the oppressive heat and lack of oxygen 
        in the balcony torture chamber. So this reviewer staggered down the back 
        stairs and out into the balmy Indian-summer evening thinking that it was 
        time to go for a cold beer. There is a wonderful cafe just behind the 
        theater on <em>rue</em> Racine near the stage door. On the way it was 
        a nice surprise to find the entire cast outside enjoying cigarettes and 
        coffee. A giggling gaggle of powdered wigs and hoop skirts seemed most 
        appropriate in this little sixteenth-century alley.<br>
        <br>
        Two of the bewigged Supers explained that they had never heard of Supers, 
        but they were in fact non-singing, non-paid actors who move things around 
        onstage and generally bring life to what would otherwise be just a dull 
        and boring opera. They proudly added that since the costumes and wigs 
        fitted them so well, they would both be appearing in <em>Le nozze di Figaro</em> 
        in 2007.<br>
        <br>
        No matter what they are called, it is the same for Supers the world over.</font></p>
