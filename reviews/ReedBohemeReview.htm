        Tom Reed, chorus</strong></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"><img src="../images/B00006LLQ1.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg" width="111" height="110" hspace="4" vspace="0" align="left">Last 
        night we did another performance of <em>La Boh&egrave;me</em>. It was 
        my 91st performance of Puccini's beloved opera, which I first performed 
        as a chorister in 1978. It's always referred to as Puccini's “beloved 
        opera” - a fact which I have always accepted without question, as evidenced 
        by packed houses and enthusiastic audiences. So imagine my shock after 
        all these years to discover the sad truth! </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">The 
        chorus has its big scene in the second act. (In our production, that's 
        the second half of the first act.) We come bouncing onto the stage in 
        front of the Caf&eacute; Momus as a frenetically happy crowd of street 
        vendors, shoppers, merchants, prune hawkers, and the like. I personally 
        play the part of an aging fruit vendor who gets attacked by a vicious 
        pack of under-medicated children.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">It's 
        a lively, wild-paced scene that's relatively short - certainly when compared 
        to, say, Wagner. It transitions seamlessly from outside the Caf&eacute; 
        to inside the Caf&eacute; where someone named Musetta has a tizzy, some 
        plates get broken, and pies get thrown. Then it transitions back outside 
        the Caf&eacute; where there's a big, happy parade and the act ends with 
        everybody in a really good mood. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">During 
        the intermission the choristers, still on adrenalin, tear off their costumes, 
        baby-wipe their faces, and pop into their street clothes. Well, alright, 
        there are a few depressed choristers who must still appear on stage at 
        the beginning of the next act, but I'm not one of them. For the majority 
        of us, all that remains is to sing the offstage chorus at the beginning 
        of the next act, and then, ever so reluctantly, go home. As the next act 
        begins, we gather offstage to sing the Trallerall&egrave;s. That's:“Tral-le-ral-l&egrave; 
        … ral-l&egrave; … ral-l&egrave; … Eva e No&egrave; … Hoppl&agrave;!” For 
        those of you who don't speak Italian, that translates roughly as“Tra-le-ra-le 
        … ra-le … ra-le … Eva e Noe … Hoppla!” Then we mob the stage door on our 
        way to the parking lots. </font></p>

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">But 
        that's not it, as I found out last night while talking to one of the props 
        guys backstage. Nooooo. Puccini didn't leave it there with everybody happy 
        and having a good time. Apparently the opera goes on for quite a while 
        after that. And in the end, guess what. The soprano <em>dies</em>!! I 
        mean, she's just the sweetest thing with a slight cough, right? Well, 
        it <em>kills </em> her!! So they were just using the chorus to set the 
        audience up so they could shock the hell out of them at the end of the 
        opera. All that energy…all that adrenalin…all those bruises…and the audience 
        goes home depressed anyway!</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"> 
        I thought it was a happy show. I thought we were making people feel good. 
        And there she is, just lying there dead! Do people really need this kind 
        of thing? I mean, look at the way things are going in this country right 
        now. Do people really need another downer?! Well, obviously they <em>do 
        </em>! I mean, they just keep flocking to the box office, don't they!? 
        I suppose I'm just going to have to stay next time all the way to the 
        bitter end and see just exactly what it is that makes audiences want to 
        hop onto this emotional roller coaster of an opera again and again. Honestly, 
        who knew? </font></p>
