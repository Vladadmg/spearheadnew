      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2"><strong>Review 
        by Michael Harvey</strong></font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">It
           seemed like a wonderful combination: a seventeenth-century opera,
          Henry 
        Purcell's <em>Dido &amp; Aeneas</em>, performed in a 30,000 sq.ft. warehouse,
         accompanied by exhibitions of molten metal casting, glass blowing, fire
        
        eating, and belly dancing. Billed as a Fire Opera and with Roy Rallo
        directing I knew we were in for something very special. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">There 
        were two huge lines an hour before the doors opened at The Crucible. A 
        few thousand of us with tickets in one - and a similar number hoping for 
        standing room in the other. We finally entered and made our way through 
        an arch and up a ramp into the vast, glittering space. If any <em>Spearhead</em> 
        readers of a certain age remember “Night Flight” or any of the decadent 
        gay party extravaganzas of the late 70's they will be able to picture 
        the scene: strobes, searchlights, and lots of twinkle-lights amid tattooed, 
        pierced, costumed and bewigged partygoers of all persuasions and flavors. 
        It did not call to mind any recent event at the Opera House. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Seating 
        was unreserved so we snagged a couple of spots on the aisle, house left, 
        in a performance area reminiscent of the Civic Center's a few years back. 
        The stage was long and shallow with the pit upstage center, and the audience 
        spread out in very wide rows. Standing room had no direct view of the 
        stage and turned out to be a vicarious party experience in front of big 
        projection screens in the bar area. It was all a bit haphazard - but nobody 
        cared. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Our
          seats were perfect since all of the entrances passed right by us. The
          show started with dozens of belly dancers screaming and generally doing
          a Greek chorus kind of thing. A couple of hunky Supers were pushing
          a
        big fountain-like sculpture ridden by a woman who might have been Mercury,
          the Spirit of the Sorceress. With sparks flying, a giant gantry holding
          a huge crucible of real molten
        metal soared over the audience and was lowered to the stage so that artists,
          in silver protective gear, could pour the flaming stuff into a mold.
          This
        turned into the magic spear used by Aeneas later in the show. A glass
          artist then fired up a torch and created a gorgeous glass &quot;wand&quot; for
          Dido.
        It seems that Dido was trying to decide whether or not to elope with
          Aeneas. I couldn't tell for sure since there were no supertitles and
          my knowledge
        of Greek mythology doesn't go much beyond Aesop. See Ulrica's <a href="#notes">notes</a>.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">According
          to the Stanford University Libretto <a href="http://opera.stanford.edu/iu/libretti/dido.html" target="_blank">database</a>,
          Dido &amp; Aeneas was first performed in 1689 at Mr. Josias Priest's
          Boarding School for Young
          Gentlewomen so we were  amazed to see a procession of bare-breasted
          Valkyries sporting flame-spouting
          
        antlers. Soon the flying gantry arrived again carrying a magical ship
          full of pirates, and lots of swordplay ensued between some jolly sailors
          and Aeneas. From 
        time to time a huge metal tree would whirl and blue lights would twinkle
           as  handmaidens pumped pistons into cylinders that produced strange
          moaning sounds. 
        Just to keep us from getting bored, a giant forklift entered stage right
           supporting two aerialists who did amazing trapeze tricks and some
          astounding 
        stuff with a long piece of red fabric.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">During
          one ethereal aria Dido  shot skyward on a concealed neon-ringed scissor
          lift. This was followed by a couple of magic thunderstorms during which
          a Wagnerian horn-helmeted god would pop up from a big copper structure
          and bang
          on sheets of
          steel 
        hanging from the ceiling. Oh, and there were plenty of big orange sparklers
           and other pyrotechnics constantly going off. After all this, Dido
          decided 
        not to go with Aeneas, and her friends Belinda and the Sorceress helpfully
          set her on fire. This was not some lame <em>auto-da-f&eacute;</em> with
          fluttering red cloth lit from below: This was an enormous roaring pyre
          six
          feet 
        high that  seemed to consume the mezzo in no time and threatened the
          audience and a good part of Oakland's warehouse district with immolation.&nbsp; Fire
          Opera, indeed!</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">During
           all of this there was also some really wonderful music. The San Francisco
          
        Bach Soloists and choir were directed by maestro Jeffrey Tate. Dance
          and  spectacle were provided by Mark Growden, Xeno, Ultra Gypsy and
          members 
        of The Crucible faculty and artists. Dido was exquisitely sung by SFO
           Adler Fellow mezzo-soprano Katherine Rohrer. Adler Fellow Greta Feeney,
          
        soprano, was Belinda, and SFO soloist Shawnette Sulker was also featured
          as the Sorceress.  The show was directed by SFO AD Roy Rallo and produced
          by <a href="http://www.thecrucible.org" target="_blank">The
        Crucible's</a> Michael Sturtz. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">If
           there is another Fire Opera next year, insert your best metal body
          ornaments, dye 
        your hair orange, break out your asbestos cape and be first in line for
           an incredible evening of theater. </font></p>

        and eventually Aeneas agrees to do so. As his ship pulls out of the harbor
