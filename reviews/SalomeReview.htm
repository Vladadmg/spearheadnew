        &nbsp; Oscar Wilde as Salome, c.1894</font><font size="2"> <br>
        <img src="images/salome.jpg" width="183" height="281" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="left">In 
        his rave review of <em>Salome</em>, the <em>New York Times</em>' Anthony 
        Tommasini dismissed me and all those other boo-ers on March 15 as the 
        usual &quot;contingent of traditionalists&quot; who haunt&nbsp;the Met. 
        Not me. I'm from San Francisco and I&nbsp;paid $95 each for a pair of 
        tickets because I was all ready to like the brand new J&uuml;rgen Flimm 
        production. Instead I got yet another concept production in which the 
        stage director was allowed to run roughshod over music and story, a production 
        whose staging is so busy and so silly that, instead of pulling me deeper 
        into an opera I quite like, erected a cold Lucite&nbsp;wall between us<br>
        <br>
        Soprano <a href="../Ulrica13.htm" target="_blank">Karita Mattila</a> was 
        fabulous as all the reviewers agreed (just as she was in SFO's <em>Katya 
        Kabanova</em>), and indeed I cheered her in New York as loudly as I could. 
        The whole audience did. We who booed saved our raspberries for Flimm, 
        and Flimm alone. Here are just a few reasons why: <br>
        <br>
        In his stage instructions, Richard Strauss was very direct about&nbsp;how 
        Salome should&nbsp;act and dance: &quot;Salome, being a virgin and an 
        Oriental princess,&nbsp;must be played with the simplest and most restrained 
        of gestures.&quot; So, would you call lap-dancing (yes, really), in a 
        bustiere and tap pants, on her step-father Herod, &quot;simple&quot; and 
        &quot;restrained&quot;? Would you use those words to describe the soprano 
        careening from one end of the stage to the other, climbing up and down 
        on scaffolding and railings as if they&nbsp;were monkey bars? (The woman 
        next to me whispered, &quot;I'm scared to death she's going to fall!&quot;) 
        I suppose you could say it was restrained of Mattila to just stand and 
        undulate&nbsp;while two male dancers in white dinner jackets pulled off 
        her Marlene Dietrich-like male drag trousers&#8212;with their teeth!&#8212;but 
        I wouldn't. This woman has one of the best sets of pipes in the business 
        right now. Why must she&nbsp;also be directed&nbsp;to engage in mini-Iron 
        Man competitions in productions like this? Let her sing! <br>
        <br>
        Other inspirations for booing: Herod's Ricky Ricardo-like white satin 
        tuxedo. The arguing Jews all decked out in contemporary Orthodox dress, 
        including homburgs and curls (very ethnically sensitive, J&uuml;rgen). 
        The&nbsp;whole damn set, which looked like a kind of Deco &quot;Love Boat&quot; 
        in the middle of a desert (I swear&nbsp;I saw Isaac mixing cocktails and 
        Julie planning the day's recreation) and included a &quot;cistern&quot; 
        that was supposed to be veddy skeddy&nbsp;deep but was, in fact, stepped 
        in repeatedly by one of the guards responsible for hauling John&nbsp;the 
        Baptist up in a giant cage that looked more like a lobster trap than prison 
        transportation.&nbsp;And then there were the Nazarenes, dressed like characters 
        in <em>Brother Where&nbsp;Art Thou</em>,&nbsp;talking about Jesus recently 
        turning water into wine at Cana to an audience of Herod party-goers all 
        dressed like the cast of <em>Dinner at Eight</em>.&nbsp;Talk about cognitive 
        dissonance. Also, much was made of the fact that Mattila did all her own 
        dancing (which involved being lifted and whirled <em>a la</em> a quasi-ballroom 
        terpsichore). Well,&nbsp;I'll allow as how she didn't embarrass herself. 
        But, believe me, she's no Cyd Charisse, so why ask her to go down that 
        difficult, specialized&nbsp;path in the first place? <br>
        <br>
        I could go on, but you get my drift. I'm not a traditionalist (I loved 
        <em>St. Francis of Assisi</em>) but when the production becomes a 3-ring 
        circus that has the stage director fairly screaming his&nbsp;interpretation 
        from the wings, I get annoyed. <br>
        <br>
        Five nights later, I went to see Mark Delavan in <em>Sweeney Todd</em> 
        at New York City Opera, and it was simply perfection. The <em>Times</em> 
        was lukewarm (what's wrong with those people?) because opera singers just 
        don't enunciate as clearly as musical stage people do, and the reviewer 
        seemed to resent the supertitles for a show that debuted on Broadway. 
        What a Mickey Mouse criticism. Taken on the whole (which is what I try 
        to do when I spend a lot of money to see something), the entire thing 
        worked big-time. Delavan brought his own&#8212;different, scary but very 
        poignant&#8212;touch to Sweeney, and it complemented beautifully the Mrs. 
        Lovett of theater vet Elaine Paige. (Devalan, a former Adler Fellow, is 
        in truly superb voice these days, as anyone who saw him in the semi-staged 
        <em>Dutchman</em> at SF Symphony last season can attest.) The orchestra 
        was supportive (or driving when it was called for), all the secondary 
        roles were&nbsp;well-sung and acted&nbsp;and&#8212; miracle of miracles&#8212;the 
        staging was an enhancement,&nbsp;not a&nbsp;&quot;Look at me! Aren't I 
        clever?&quot; indulgence by some guy who cannot possibly value the essence 
        of opera&#8212;the <em>singing</em>!&#8212;as much as he does his own 
        auteur's &quot;vision.&quot; <br>
        <br>
        OK. I feel better now.</font></p>
