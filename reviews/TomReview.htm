      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">by <font size="2"><a href="../Interviews/carlisleinterview.html">Tom 
        Carlisle</a> </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2" style="color:red;"><img src="images/Carlisle/thin.jpg" width="101" height="269" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="left"></font><font size="2">I 
        reluctantly put pen to paper at this rather late date to record a few 
        thoughts on a production I <em>almost </em> saw of <em>Der Rosenkavalier 
        </em> at Covent Garden last April. Or to be more precise, one quarter 
        of the performance I saw from the worst seat I have ever had in an opera 
        house in the entire world (that really means Europe and the U.S.A.). (<em>At 
        left, the view from B71. Below, how it is supposed to be seen</em>.) I 
        have had better visibility from standing room in most theatres. Be cautious 
        of tickets that say “seat with restricted view,” which I have had before 
        at Covent Garden, but never this bad. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">About 
        the only thing I can review at this point would be the orchestra playing 
        under <strong>Sir Charles Mackeras </strong>, which was sumptuous, and 
        the singing, but very little of the portrayals of the principals. Most 
        memorable was <strong>Angelika Kirchschlahger </strong>as Octavian, in 
        good voice and very convincing as the young nobleman, and Simone Nold, 
        a very young and pretty sweet-voiced Sophie. <strong>Kurt Rydl </strong>was 
        a dependable, if not totally convincingly boorish, Baron von Ochs. <strong>Felicity 
        Lott </strong> is a mainstay at Covent Garden, but I found her Marschallin 
        unmoving particularly in the final scene of Act I, which almost always 
        brings me to tears. </font></p>

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Not 
        being able to see much of the action onstage, I concentrated (with the 
        help of opera glasses) on the makeup and costumes of the participants 
        I <em>could </em> see. The latter were outstanding but I found the makeup 
        to be atrocious—I am sure by intent. Everyone was extremely white and 
        pasty, and Angelika had huge bags under her eyes, which I do not remember 
        seeing at a Christmas party at Pamela's, when she was here for <em>The 
        Merry Widow</em>. </font></p>

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2">“The 
        Quarter Review” could also refer to the four plays I saw in London at 
        the same time. Unfortunately for anyone heading to London this summer, 
        they are no longer on the boards, but here goes. The very best of all 
        happened to be <em>All's Well That Ends Well </em>with <strong>Dame Judi 
        Dench </strong> as the Countess of Rossillion, and an outstanding cast 
        of supporting actors from the Royal Shakespeare Company. Though not perhaps 
        the leading role of the play, she nevertheless always commands the stage 
        when she is on it. I would also like to make a small plug here for one 
        of my favorite young actors on the British stage, <strong>Guy Henry</strong>, 
        who was insidious as the rascally Parolles. I once rode a bus with him 
        in Straford-upon-Avon, and one and a half hours later saw him on stage 
        in <em>The Virtuoso </em>, and I have seen him proceed to prominent roles 
        in the subsequent fourteen years, such as the poet Turgenev in <strong>Tom 
        Stoppard's </strong> masterful <em>The Coast of Utopia </em>. </font></p>

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Another 
        stage treat was the rarely performed <em>Henry IV </em> by <strong>Luigi 
        Pirandello </strong> (there was an Italian film version several years 
        ago with <strong>Marcello Mastroiani </strong>, as the French Henri IV, 
        which I guess no one saw but me. This is a new, and I must say, delightfully 
        short, translation by Tom Stoppard at the Donmar with an excellent cast 
        headed by <strong>Ian McDiarmid </strong> (who seems to have been in all 
        of the <em>Star Wars </em> movies) as Henry (shades of Olivier in his 
        mad scenes) and <strong>Francesa Annis </strong> bringing the whole play 
        to a shockingly dramatic climax. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">On 
        the lighter side was a delightful comic romp starring <strong>Simon Callow 
        </strong> (remember him from <em>Four Weddings </em>?) as a ruthless press 
        baron on his way to a nervous breakdown and its aftermath, written by 
        <strong>Simon Gray </strong>, author of <em>Butley </em> and other West 
        End hits. The sight of Simon Callow stripping down to his jockey shorts 
        in one scene was quite unnerving and I am glad he didn't go any further. 
        </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">The 
        biggest disappointment, at least for me, was the National Theatre's production 
        of <em>Cyrano de Bergerac. </em>I was looking for a traditional, old-fashioned 
        romantic tearjerker and what I got was a mishmash of styles, time periods 
        and a chorus line of dancing cadets. As the <em>Daily Telegraph </em> 
        critic (not <em>the</em>) <strong></strong> <em></em><strong>Charles Spenser 
        </strong> put it: “As perverse an assault on a much-loved classic as I 
        can recall.” When you have a new translation (by <strong>Derek Mahon</strong>) 
        which combines references of the world of Louis XIII with corporate executives, 
        tax evasion and other modern evils, contemporary slang and Cyrano telling 
        an adversary to f*** off (I guess if it's good enough for our vice-president…) 
        and other expletives I care not to mention, it made for one distressing 
        evening. <strong>Stephen Rea </strong> was exceptionally energetic in 
        his own puppy-dog way and did bring a bit of poetry to the balcony scene 
        with Roxanne and Christian. But to quote Charles Spenser again: “He was 
        never allowed to succeed in breaking your heart.”</font></p>
