      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Between 
        performances of <em>La Boh&egrave;me, </em> I took a short trip down to 
        the great city to the south (Los Angeles) to begin work on a film history 
        research project I've been nurturing for a few years; also to see an important 
        Minimalist retrospective at <a href="http://www.moca.org" target="_blank">MOCA</a> 
        and to scope out the new <a href="http://www.musiccenter.org/wdch/" target="_blank">Disney 
        Concert Hall</a> (truly amazing, though nothing was playing there). </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">I'm 
        almost incapable of going somewhere that doesn't have opera scheduled 
        while I'm visiting, so I managed to get cheap, but decent, seats for the 
        last two performances of the <a href="http://www.losangelesopera.com" target="_blank">LA 
        Opera</a>'s 2003–04 season, <em>La Nozze di Figaro </em> and <em>Il Trovatore</em>. 
        Both productions featured singers who are attracting a lot of attention 
        nationally, and each was well conceived, communicating the many levels 
        of meaning in these two very complex operas. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">

        Saturday night was the <em>Figaro </em> starring <strong>Domingo </strong> 
        prot&eacute;g&eacute; (and winner of his <em>Operalia </em> competition 
        in 1998) <strong>Erwin Schrott</strong>,<strong> </strong> who, Germanic 
        name aside, hails from Uruguay and is another great-looking baritone (baritone 
        connoisseur <strong>Pat Beresford</strong>, who was down there a few weeks 
        earlier, had told me to look out for him). The opening scene had Figaro 
        painting his new quarters bright red, prior to the eponymous wedding. 
        It was a startling visual as he rolled scarlet paint onto the high walls, 
        his voice and presence robust and virile. The original Susanna for the 
        production, <strong>Isabel Bayrakdarian</strong>, was up here in San Francisco 
        singing Mahler, so the earlier Barbarina, <strong>Jessica Rivera</strong>, 
        who was delightful in every way, took the role. <em>Figaro </em> is an 
        ensemble piece, and the cast was evenly excellent. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Mezzo 
        <strong>Sandra Piques-Eddy </strong> made an adorable, awkwardly adolescent 
        Cherubino, and her <em>Voi che sapete </em> was utterly charming. A slightly 
        weaker spot was the somewhat out-of-focus Countess of <strong>Darina Takova</strong>. 
        It is a role open to a wide variety of interpretations (she is, after 
        all, the mischievous Rosina of <em>The Barber of Seville</em>), including 
        <strong>Carol Vaness</strong>'<strong> </strong> Covent Garden performances 
        of the character as a bored and lonely lush. But it seemed that Takova 
        did not know whether to play it as the grand lady of the house looking 
        for payback from her unfaithful husband, or as an older Rosina out for 
        a little more fun and relishing her conspiracy with the servants. However, 
        the Countess' aria of sadness and regret, <em>Dove sono</em>, is always 
        a joy to hear, and Takova performed it beautifully. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">But
          I&nbsp;must confess that I&nbsp;have yet&nbsp;to see the point of,
          nor enjoy, the final scene of Figaro. It always seems unnecessary,
          never funny, and I wonder why, after the preceeding 'false' ending,&nbsp;Mozart
          didn't just let us go home a little earlier. But then, I feel the same
          about parts of Strauss' homage to <em>Figaro</em>, 
        <em>Der Rosenkavalier </em> (not to mention all of his <em>Arabella</em>)
         so maybe someone else can point out the appeal of the garden scene.
        It 
        was nicely handled here, though, with the anachronistically dressed characters
         carrying flashlights to illuminate their way through a deep blue scene.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"><img src="images/1523112652004WEBSITETrovNew.jpg" width="187" height="273" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="left">The 
        following night was, simply put, the best <em>Trovatore </em> I have ever 
        seen and one of my greatest nights at the opera. Although it had some 
        of the idiosyncrasies of the last SFO production (no anvils in the anvil 
        chorus), it fortunately had much more color and much more of the energetic 
        movement of soldiers and gypsies that accompany the thrill of <em>Di quella 
        pira </em> and complement the soaring and mournful Act IV <em>scena</em>. 
        </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">It 
        has been said that <em>Trovatore</em> is an easy opera to perform: all 
        you need are four <em>great </em> voices—and that was happily the case 
        here. Ever constant <strong>Dolora Zajick </strong> was the vengeful gypsy 
        Azucena, of course (would she <em>allow </em> anyone else to sing the 

        part?), and <strong>Roberto Frontali </strong>was a very accomplished 
        and menacing Count di Luna. The tenor was <strong>Franco Farina</strong>,<strong> 
        </strong> who had the notes and the swagger to portray a very memorable 
        Manrico.</font></p>

      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">But 
        the night undoubtedly belonged to American soprano Sondra Radvanovsky 
        as the neurotic Leonora. It was a stunning performance, and if you don't 
        believe me, go to her<a href="http://www.sondraradvanovsky.com/" target="_blank"> 
        website</a> and read some reviews. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Not 
        only is she making a name for herself as a Verdi soprano at the Met (<em>Luisa 
        Miller </em> and an upcoming, not-to-be-missed <em>I Vespri Siciliani</em>), 
        San Diego (<em>Don Carlo</em>), and in Europe, but she is one of those 
        increasingly rare sopranos with an unmistakable timbre to their voice; 
        in this case, something along the lines of <strong>Magda Olivero </strong> 
        singing Verdi or a more dramatic and interesting <strong>Angela Ghiorghiou</strong>. 
        </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">I 
        have had the privilege of seeing a handful of definitive and revelatory 
        performances over the past 22 years (<strong>Gwyneth Jones</strong>'<strong> 
        </strong> Elektra and Br&uuml;nnhilde, <strong>Catherine Malfitano</strong>'s<strong> 
        </strong> Madama Butterfly, <strong>Shirley Verrett</strong>'s Lady Macbeth, 
        and <strong>Olga Borodina</strong>'s Dalila come to mind), and this performance 
        ranked up there with them all. </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">Ms. 
        Radvanovsky played Leonora as a crazy, deranged woman, instead of the 
        sad victim we often see. She fetishized Manrico's sword and distractedly 
        cut herself with it; she had to be led away by her companion Inez, and 
        had a jumpy nervousness throughout. Her look was wild-eyed and disturbing, 
        hair coming undone, and it makes perfect sense that this woman, who so 
        willingly swallows poison on the faint delusional promise of saving her 
        lover, would not be totally of sound mind! Her exquisite <em>D'amor sull'ali 
        rosee</em> was ethereal and really did seem to float on rosy wings. The 
        subsequent plummet to the chant of the <em>Miserere </em> gave us an insight 
        into the despair of an unhinged woman. Let me please, one day, see <em>her 
        </em> Sleepwalking scene… </font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><font size="2">This 
        production was unusually interesting in that it performed the rarely heard 
        1857 revision for the Paris Op&eacute;ra (albeit still sung in Italian). 
        This included part of the original, and entertaining, ballet music, which 
        was performed as a dark scene of the torment and rape of three gypsy women, 
        segueing from the Anvil scene. They also used the Paris ending, which 
        incorporates some of the <em>Miserere </em> music into the chilling climax 
        and gives us a more believable stretch of time for <em>Manrico </em> to 
        be taken offstage and executed. There was an overall powerful sense of 
        movement to this production, particularly during the Act I quartet, and 
        a gorgeous palette of rich, earthy colors offsetting the characteristic 
        black shadows and silhouettes.</font></p>
      <p class="spearhead" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="2"><em>Trovatore 
        </em> is often held up as one of the more preposterous operas, but this 
        Los Angeles production showed us a truly emotionally unsettling piece 
        that carried with it the dramatic truth that makes great opera. <em>Fabulous</em>!
